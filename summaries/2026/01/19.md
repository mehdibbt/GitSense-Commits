# Activity Summary for 1/19/2026

## 2:36:30 PM
The changes log details updates across several JavaScript/React files within the `sitenettech\api-client` project, primarily focusing on folder management and review features. All recorded modifications occurred on **January 19, 2026**, suggesting a focused development session.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderReview\FolderReview.jsx`**
    *   **Initial State & Minor Debugging (1:54:58 PM - 1:59:33 PM):** The file remained largely consistent in its initial entries, importing various React hooks, UI components, and icons, and setting up numerous state variables for a "Folder Review" page. It defines logic for fetching user information from Supabase and processing folder options based on available services.
    *   **Debugging Console Log (2:00:15 PM):** A `console.log` statement was added to output the `folderData` object's keys, likely for debugging purposes (`console.log("folderData in FolderReview:", Object.keys(folderData).length);`).
    *   **State Initialization Change (2:00:48 PM):** The `folderData` state was initialized as an empty object (`{}`) instead of `null` (`const [folderData, setFolderData] = useState({});`).
    *   **Tab Comment-out (2:15:38 PM):** The "Client Contact" tab definition within the `tabs` array was commented out, indicating a potential removal or temporary deactivation of that specific tab's functionality from the UI.

2.  **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderList.jsx`**
    *   **Comprehensive Folder Listing Component (1:57:23 PM):** This single entry details the creation or significant update of a `FolderList` component. It includes:
        *   **State Management:** Extensively uses `useState` for loading, button states, modal visibility, pagination, table data, filters, and settings.
        *   **Data Fetching:** Implements `fetchListAllData` from a utility function, and `getTopSummaryCounts` for dashboard-like summaries. It uses Supabase for data interaction and real-time updates via a Supabase channel listener.
        *   **Form Management:** Utilizes `useFormik` for folder creation (`folderSave`) with schema validation (`folderCreateSchema`) and for filtering data (`filterData`).
        *   **Navigation:** Uses `useNavigate` to redirect to `folderEdit` after creation.
        *   **UI Elements:** Renders `Pageheader`, `DataTableList`, `FilterModal`, `ModalCustom`, `ModalSidebarSetting`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`, and includes components for creating and filtering folders (`FolderCreateBody`, `FolderFilterBody`).
        *   **User/Company Context:** Fetches user and company details using `useAuth` and `useCompanyAndComUser` hooks.

3.  **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingDetails\parts\Passengers.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Passengers Component (2:16:27 PM):** This file defines a `Passengers` component responsible for displaying passenger information in a data table. It includes logic for conditional rendering of an "Action" column, allowing users to add/edit eTicket numbers via a modal, or view a PDF itinerary.

4.  **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderReview\parts\Passengers\Passengers.jsx`**
    *   **Component Relocation (2:16:51 PM):** The `Passengers.jsx` component was effectively moved from a more general `components/Backend/Interface/BookingDetails/parts` path to `pages/backend/Folder/FolderReview/parts`, suggesting a refactoring to place components closer to their primary usage context. The content at this timestamp is identical to the previous entry, confirming the move.
    *   **Modal Removal from Render (2:17:01 PM):** The `ModalCustom` component for adding/editing eTicket numbers was removed from the component's rendered output, though its state variables remained declared.
    *   **Import Path Correction (2:17:14 PM):** The import path for `DataTableList` was updated to reflect its new relative location (`../../../../../../components/UI/DataTable/DataTableList`).
    *   **Prop Destructuring Change & Debugging (2:18:25 PM):** The `folderInvoiceStatus` prop was removed from the component's deconstruction (`const Passengers = ({ allData }) => {`), and a `console.log` was added to inspect `allData`.
    *   **Action Column Removal (2:24:52 PM):** The "Action" column, which contained the eTicket editing and PDF download links, was completely removed from the `tableColumn` definition. This implies the removal of interactive eTicket management from this display.
    *   **Major Refactoring & Simplification (2:26:47 PM):** The component underwent a significant overhaul:
        *   Removed all `useState` hooks related to eTicket editing (`eticketEditModalOpen`, `btnLoading`, `editedPassId`, `selectedPassenger`).
        *   Simplified data access by directly deconstructing `passengers` from `allData`.
        *   Introduced a `useMemo` hook to `tableData` to map and format raw passenger data into a structure suitable for the `DataTableList`.
        *   The `tableColumn` definition was simplified to a static array, focusing purely on displaying passenger attributes without any interactive elements.
        *   Removed the `console.log` statement. The component is now a pure display component.

5.  **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderReview\parts\AirSegments\AirSegments.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Placeholder (2:33:05 PM):** The component started as a basic placeholder, logging `allData` and rendering "AirSegments".
    *   **DataTable Integration (2:34:22 PM):** The component was significantly developed to display air segment data. It now:
        *   Imports `dayjs` and `useMemo`.
        *   Deconstructs `airsegments` from `allData`.
        *   Uses `useMemo` to process `airsegments` into `tableData`, extracting and formatting details like departure/arrival cities, dates, times, flight numbers, class, airline, and baggage.
        *   Defines `tableColumn` using `useMemo`, with specific styles and templates for date formatting.
        *   Renders a `DataTableList` to display the formatted air segment data.

6.  **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderReview\parts\AirTickets\AirTickets.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Placeholder (2:33:11 PM):** The component remains a basic placeholder, logging `allData` and rendering "AirTicket".

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Component Refactoring & Organization:** A clear pattern of moving existing UI components (like `Passengers.jsx`) to more specific, feature-oriented directories (`FolderReview/parts`) suggests an ongoing effort to improve the project's architecture and modularity.
*   **Shift from Interactive to Display-Only:** The `Passengers.jsx` component notably transitioned from handling eTicket editing and actions to becoming a purely display-focused component, indicating that interaction logic might be moved elsewhere or redesigned.
*   **Data Table Usage:** `DataTableList` is a recurring UI component used to display structured lists of data (passengers, air segments). This points to a standardized approach for presenting tabular information.
*   **`useMemo` for Data Preparation:** Both `Passengers.jsx` and `AirSegments.jsx` leverage `useMemo` to process and format incoming `allData` into `tableData` and `tableColumn` definitions, optimizing performance by memoizing these computations.
*   **`dayjs` for Date Formatting:** `dayjs` is consistently used for parsing and formatting date strings, particularly for display in data tables.
*   **Supabase Integration:** The application actively uses Supabase for backend data operations, including real-time updates (`FolderList.jsx`) and user information retrieval (`FolderReview.jsx`).
*   **Consistent UI Component Library Usage:** The project uses a set of custom UI components (`Pageheader`, `Button`, `ModalCustom`, `DataTableList`, etc.) from a `components/UI` directory, along with `flowbite-react` for tooltips and `react-icons` for various icons, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
