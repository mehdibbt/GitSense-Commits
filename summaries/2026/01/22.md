# Activity Summary for 1/22/2026

## 2:22:08 PM
The provided log details changes across three files within a `sitenettech` React application, primarily focusing on `FolderReview.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderReview\FolderReview.jsx`**

This file experienced numerous small, iterative changes between **1/22/2026, 1:32:35 PM** and **1/22/2026, 2:19:31 PM**. The key updates revolve around debugging and data mapping logic:

*   **Debugging `useEffect` and `getFolderOptions` (1:50:30 PM - 2:06:01 PM):**
    *   `console.log` statements were frequently added and modified within the `useEffect` hook that handles `propsData` and `sessionStorage`, specifically to inspect the `propsData` object.
    *   Similarly, the `getFolderOptions` function saw multiple `console.log` additions to observe the `response` and `serviceKey` values during its execution. These additions include separator lines for better readability in the console.
*   **Refining `responseKeyToServiceKey` Mapping (2:08:53 PM - 2:10:43 PM):**
    *   The `responseKeyToServiceKey` object, responsible for mapping incoming data keys (like `flights`) to internal service keys (like `ticket`), underwent several revisions.
    *   Initially, at **2:08:53 PM**, many keys were changed to plural forms (e.g., `flights: 'tickets'`, `hotels: 'hotels'`).
    *   This was quickly reverted to singular keys at **2:09:31 PM** (e.g., `flight: 'ticket'`, `hotel: 'hotel'`).
    *   A subsequent adjustment at **2:10:02 PM** attempted to stabilize the mapping by using plural keys (e.g., `tickets: 'ticket'`, `hotels: 'hotel'`) while keeping the service *values* singular.
    *   The final state in the log for this object at **2:10:43 PM** maintained plural keys and singular values for most services (e.g., `tickets: 'ticket'`, `hotels: 'hotel'`).
*   **Session Data Handling Correction (2:00:09 PM - 2:01:17 PM):**
    *   A correction was applied within the `useEffect` that handles `sessionStorage`. When retrieving data from `sessionStorage`, the `setTravelOption` function was initially called with `propsData` instead of `session.data` (**2:00:09 PM**). This was corrected at **2:01:17 PM** to use `session.data`, ensuring that `travelOption` is correctly set from the restored session data.

**`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderList.jsx`**

Only one log entry exists for this file at **1/22/2026, 2:06:31 PM**. This entry shows a comprehensive `FolderList` React component. It includes:
*   State management for loading, filtering, pagination, and modals.
*   Integration with Supabase for data fetching and real-time updates for the `folders` table.
*   Form handling using Formik for folder creation (with `folderCreateSchema` validation) and filtering.
*   Functions for saving list settings, handling data deletion, and calculating top summary counts.
*   Usage of various UI components like `Button`, `DataTableList`, `Pageheader`, and different modal types.

**`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderReview\parts\AirTickets\AirTickets.jsx`**

This file experienced a single, notable change between **1/22/2026, 2:12:57 PM** and **1/22/2026, 2:13:51 PM**:

*   **Component Import Path Update (2:13:51 PM):** The import path for the `DataTableList` component was updated from `../../../../UI/DataTable/DataTableList` to `../../../../../../components/UI/DataTable/DataTableList`. This indicates a refactoring or relocation of the shared `DataTableList` component within the project's directory structure.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging Focus:** A strong recurring pattern, especially in `FolderReview.jsx`, is the heavy use and iteration of `console.log` statements. This indicates active development and debugging sessions, likely to understand data flow and state changes.
*   **Data Mapping Challenges:** The repeated changes to `responseKeyToServiceKey` in `FolderReview.jsx` highlight a common challenge in front-end development: correctly mapping data structures received from an API to the application's internal data model, especially when dealing with slightly inconsistent naming conventions (plural vs. singular keys).
*   **Session Storage for State Persistence:** `FolderReview.jsx` utilizes `sessionStorage` to temporarily store parsed folder data (`folderReviewData`) for 5 minutes, providing a mechanism for short-term data persistence to improve user experience across refreshes or navigation.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The project adheres to a component-based architecture, with distinct components like `FolderReview`, `FolderList`, `AirSegments`, `AirTickets`, and various UI elements (`Button`, `ModalCustom`, `DataTableList`).
*   **Supabase Integration:** Both `FolderList.jsx` and `FolderReview.jsx` show reliance on Supabase for backend interactions, including data retrieval and real-time updates for `folders`.
*   **Consistent UI Component Usage:** Across `FolderList` and `AirTickets`, there's a consistent usage of custom UI components like `DataTableList`, `Pageheader`, and `Button`, suggesting a shared component library or design system.
