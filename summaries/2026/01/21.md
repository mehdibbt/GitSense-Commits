# Activity Summary for 1/21/2026

## 2:18:32 PM
The changes log exclusively pertains to the file `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderReview\FolderReview.jsx`.

Key updates include:
*   **1/21/2026, 1:47:36 PM:** A `console.log` statement that displayed the length of `folderData` was commented out, suggesting the completion or pausing of a debugging step.
*   **1/21/2026, 1:49:24 PM:** A significant change involved an `useEffect` hook responsible for managing `folderData` state based on `location.state?.parsedData` (`propsData`) or `sessionStorage`. An older, commented-out version of this `useEffect` block was replaced with an active one. The updated logic explicitly sets `folderData` to an empty object (`{}`) when data is not found in `propsData` and has expired or is absent from `sessionStorage`, adding a comment `// ✅ SAFE` to this operation. This indicates a more robust and intentional handling of initial/missing data.
*   **1/21/2026, 2:08:19 PM:** The entire `FolderReview` React functional component was commented out, temporarily disabling its functionality. This is a common practice for isolating issues or during large refactorings.
*   **1/21/2026, 2:08:42 PM:** Shortly after, the entire `FolderReview` component was uncommented, restoring its previous state and functionality.

A recurring pattern in these changes is the commenting and uncommenting of code blocks, particularly `console.log` statements and the entire component. This suggests an active development or debugging phase where sections of code are frequently toggled for testing or temporary disabling. The `useEffect` block related to `folderData` and `sessionStorage` was a specific area of focus for state management logic.
