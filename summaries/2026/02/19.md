# Activity Summary for 2/19/2026

## 2:10:04 PM
The logs primarily show activity within the `FlightSearch.jsx` file located at `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightSearch\FlightSearch.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`FlightSearch.jsx`**: This React component is responsible for rendering flight search results in the Travnet Tech CRM project. It utilizes various hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`), Redux for state management (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`), and React Router for navigation (`useLocation`, `useSearchParams`, `useNavigate`).
    *   **Initial state (2/19/2026, 2:03:58 PM - 2:06:07 PM):** The component fetches flight data (`fetchFlights`), processes carrier codes and airports, sets stops and min/max prices, and manages fare rules. It also handles flight selection, adding flights to a cart, initializing a basket, and storing cart-related data in `sessionStorage` before navigating to the cart page. Loading states are managed for the flight search itself.
    *   **Significant update (between 2/19/2026, 2:06:07 PM and 2/19/2026, 2:08:01 PM):** A notable change occurred where the component's Redux state selection for `flights` was expanded. Previously, it directly selected `filteredFlights`, `isLoading`, and `currency`. In the updated version, it now also destructures `airportsLoading` and `airLinesLoding` alongside `filteredFlights` from the `state.flights` slice. This indicates an enhancement in tracking the loading status of airport and airline data separately.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The first three timestamps (2/19/2026, 2:03:58 PM, 2/19/2026, 2:04:21 PM, 2/19/2026, 2:04:30 PM) show identical code, suggesting minor saves or no functional changes.
*   The code remained the same at 2/19/2026, 2:06:07 PM.
*   A key update to the `useSelector` hook was introduced by 2/19/2026, 2:08:01 PM.
*   The code at 2/19/2026, 2:09:21 PM is identical to the one at 2:08:01 PM, indicating no further changes in the logged snippet.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   All log entries consistently refer to the same `FlightSearch.jsx` file.
*   The code within the file is largely stable across the log entries, with the primary identified change being an update to Redux state selection to include more granular loading indicators.
*   Comments at the top of the file consistently provide component details, project name, copyright, and developer information.
*   The component heavily relies on Redux for state management and `sessionStorage` for temporary data persistence like `startTime`, `cartCurrency`, and `basketExpiry`.
*   Extensive use of `console.log` for debugging purposes is evident throughout the component.
