# Activity Summary for 2/26/2026

## 2:00:16 PM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\pages\backend\Folder\FolderReview\FolderReview.jsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The file `FolderReview.jsx` appears to be a React component responsible for displaying and managing details of a "Folder" review, likely within a travel or booking management system. It imports various UI components (e.g., `Button`, `Pageheader`, `ModalCustom`, `Toast`), utility functions (e.g., `dayjs`, `uid`), and data management hooks/contexts (e.g., `useContextAuth`, `useFetchCompany`, Supabase client).

The component uses several `useState` hooks to manage its local state, including:
*   `isCollapsed`, `showCollapseIcon`: For UI collapse/expand functionality.
*   `btnLoading`, `pageLoading`: For loading states.
*   `data`, `folderData`: To store main flight/folder search details and processed folder data.
*   `editFieldInfo`, `folderInvoiceStatus`, `reissueServiceCase`, `refundScCheck`, `booking`, `folderCreatedUserflight`, `userData`: For specific data related to folder details, invoices, service cases, and user info.
*   `activeTab`, `subActiveTab`, `childActiveTab`, `travelOption`: For managing tab navigation and available travel options.
*   `isVisible`, `showPNRModal`: For modal visibility.
*   `pnrInput`, `pnrError`: For handling PNR (Passenger Name Record) input.
*   `isItineraryData`: An object to track itinerary data availability for different services (airSegment, ticket, hotel, etc.).

Key functionalities observed in the code include:
*   Fetching user data from Supabase based on `data.user_id`.
*   Processing `propsData` (likely passed via `react-router-dom`'s `location.state`) to construct `updatedTickets` by combining passenger, air segment, and ticket information.
*   Storing and retrieving `folderReviewData` from `sessionStorage` to persist data across page loads, with an expiration time of 5 minutes.
*   Dynamically determining `travelOption` based on available services in the `folderData`.
*   A `useEffect` hook to display a PNR input modal if `pnrInput` is empty upon initial load.
*   Another `useEffect` to set `pnrInput` based on the first air segment's PNR once `folderData` is available.
*   `tabs` and `childTabs` arrays define navigation structures for "Passenger" and "Itinerary Item" views, further breaking down "Itinerary Item" into "Air Segment" and "Air Ticket" sub-tabs.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The log shows multiple timestamps:
*   2/26/2026, 1:35:30 PM
*   2/26/2026, 1:37:04 PM

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**
A striking pattern is that the *entire code content provided is identical across all entries*. This indicates that while the file was saved or updated at these distinct timestamps, no actual functional or textual code changes were introduced into the file between these recorded events. It could represent multiple saves without modifications, automated build/reformat triggers, or a series of minor changes not captured by the provided diff context (e.g., changes to whitespace, comments, or external configurations that result in a file save without altering the core logic presented).
