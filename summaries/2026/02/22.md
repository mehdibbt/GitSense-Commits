# Activity Summary for 2/22/2026

## 12:39:05 PM
The changes log details updates primarily related to the flight search functionality and its associated styling within the `api-client` project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightContent\FlightContent.jsx`**
    *   The core `FlightContent` component underwent significant development starting around **2/22/2026, 11:48:23 AM**. This component manages flight search parameters such as journey type (one-way, return), departure/return dates, airports, passenger counts (adults, children, infants), and cabin class.
    *   Key logic within this file includes state management for these search parameters, date handling (e.g., setting `minDateReturn` and `maxDate` based on departure date), and input value handlers.
    *   The `submitForm` function incorporates robust validation logic, checking for missing departure/return airports, ensuring departure and return airports are not identical, validating date selections, and crucially, ensuring all children's ages are selected if children are included in the search. It also structures the flight search data into `searchAirLegs` objects, populating details like airport codes, names, city, and country for both origin and destination.
    *   At **2/22/2026, 11:54:23 AM**, an import for `Tooltip` from `flowbite-react` was added, suggesting potential UI enhancements or new interactive elements involving tooltips.

*   **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\assets\modules\Search\Search.css`**
    *   Starting from **2/22/2026, 11:50:41 AM**, this CSS file received comprehensive styling updates for various search interface elements. This includes:
        *   Styles for search tabs (`.search-tab-btn`, `.search-tab-headers`, `.search-type`) including active states, font properties, and layout.
        *   Styling for form groups (`.form-group`), inputs, and Ant Design `Select` components, defining their appearance, focus states, and error handling.
        *   Specific styles for flight search sections (`.flight-container`, `.journey-info`, `.traveler-info`, `.cabin-class`), covering layout, passenger input fields, and cabin class dropdowns.
        *   Responsive design adjustments for various screen widths (e.g., `max-width: 424px`, `max-width: 639px`, `max-width: 768px`) to ensure usability across devices.
    *   A minor update at **2/22/2026, 11:51:30 AM** modified the `.flight-container .flight-submitBtn button` style, specifically adding a `hover:shadow-3xl` effect to the existing `shadow-2xl`, enhancing its interactive visual feedback.

*   **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Search\Sidebar\Flight\AirlinePanel\AirlinePanel.jsx`**
    *   On **2/22/2026, 12:20:40 PM**, the `AirlinePanel` component was introduced or significantly updated. This component is designed for filtering airlines within a sidebar.
    *   It uses Ant Design's `Collapse` component to provide an expandable panel for "AirLines" filtering.
    *   The panel features a "Check All" checkbox and a list of individual airline checkboxes, managed by `SearchCheckbox` components.
    *   Custom scrollbar implementation using `react-custom-scrollbars-2` is in place for the list of airlines, with specific styling for the scrollbar thumb and track.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Concentrated Development Time**: All significant changes occurred on **2/22/2026**, primarily between 11:48 AM and 12:20 PM, indicating a focused work session on the flight search features.
*   **Flight Search Module Focus**: The updates are consistently centered around enhancing the flight search functionality, encompassing the main search form, its styling, and sidebar filtering capabilities.
*   **UI/UX Improvement**: The changes show a strong emphasis on user interface and experience, including form validation, visual feedback (e.g., button hover effects), and responsive design.
*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The use of React components (`FlightContent`, `AirlinePanel`) along with various UI libraries (`@headlessui/react`, `@mui/material`, `antd`, `flowbite-react`) highlights a component-driven development approach.
*   **Repetitive Saves**: Multiple identical code entries for `FlightContent.jsx` and `Search.css` with slightly differing timestamps suggest frequent saves during active development without major functional changes between those specific log entries.

        *   A new import `shallowEqual` from `react-redux` was added at **1:54:23 PM** and applied to the `flights` selector (`useSelector( (state) => state.flights.filteredFlights, shallowEqual )`), indicating an optimization to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the `filteredFlights` array itself changes, but its content remains shallowly equal.
        *   New `sortOptions` for flight search results were introduced, including 'Recommended', 'Price (lowest to highest/highest to lowest)', and 'Duration (shortest/longest)'.

*   **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\features\Flight\flightsSlice.js`**
    *   **Timestamp (2/22/2026, 1:04:35 PM - 1:06:45 PM):** This Redux slice file received significant updates, primarily around API endpoints and new asynchronous actions.
        *   At **1:04:35 PM**, the `fetchFlights` thunk was updated to use `VITE_REACT_APP_TSE_V2_URL` (which was changed in the .env to `api/v1` instead of `api/v2`).
        *   An initial framework for background fetching of airlines and airports was added within `fetchFlighstData` at **1:04:35 PM**, dispatching `fetchAirlines` and `fetchAirports` without awaiting them.
        *   At **1:06:45 PM**, comments were added to logically group the `createAsyncThunk` functions (e.g., "FLIGHTS", "AIRPORTS", "AIRLINES", "MAIN SEARCH", "FARE RULES", "BAGGAGE", "SELECT FLIGHT").
        *   A new thunk, `fetchBaggageInfo`, was introduced to fetch baggage details via a `/baggages` endpoint, using the selected flight's session key, flight ID, and segment ID.
        *   The `selectFlight` thunk's pending, fulfilled, and rejected cases in `extraReducers` were expanded to handle `isLoading` and `isError` states more comprehensively.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **2/22/2026, 11:48:23 AM:** Initial detailed changes to `FlightContent.jsx` related to form submission logic and flight search data structure.
*   **2/22/2026, 11:51:30 AM:** CSS modification in `Search.css` for button hover effects.
*   **2/22/2026, 11:54:23 AM:** Addition of `Tooltip` import in `FlightContent.jsx`.
*   **2/22/2026, 12:01:05 PM:** `.env` file updated to include `VITE_REACT_APP_TSE_V2_URL`, indicating a new API version endpoint was added. (Though later changed back to `v1` at 12:05:26 PM, suggesting a rollback or correction).

*   **2/22/2026, 1:54:23 PM:** Performance optimization in `FlightSearch.jsx` using `shallowEqual` for Redux selector.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Flight Search Focus:** The majority of changes revolve around refining the flight search functionality, including user input, validation, API interaction, data display, and state management.
*   **Redux for State Management:** The project extensively uses Redux (`createAsyncThunk`, `createSlice`, `useDispatch`, `useSelector`) for managing application state, particularly for flight data, loading states, and search parameters.
*   **UI Component Refinements:** Updates to `FlightContent.jsx` and `Search.css` indicate ongoing work on user interface and user experience, such as form validation, date pickers, input styling, and button effects.
*   **API Interaction:** There's a clear pattern of interacting with a `TSE` (Travnet Tech Search Engine) API for fetching flight data, airport names, airline names, fare rules, and baggage information. The introduction of `VITE_REACT_APP_TSE_V2_URL` suggests an evolution of the API.
*   **Performance and Optimization:** The addition of `shallowEqual` in `FlightSearch.jsx` and the asynchronous (non-awaited) background fetching in `flightsSlice.js` demonstrate an effort to optimize performance and user experience by decoupling non-critical data fetches.
*   **Detailed Data for Search:** The `submitForm` in `FlightContent.jsx` is being enhanced to send more granular details (like `departAirportName`, `destinationAirportName`, `originCityName`, `originCountryName`, etc.) with flight search requests, indicating a move towards richer search capabilities.
*   **Cart Integration:** The `selectFlightHandeller` in `FlightSearch.jsx` shows a recurring pattern of initializing a cart, adding events to it, and managing session-based expiry for cart items.

## 3:39:04 PM
The `.env` file, located at `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\.env`, was updated at 2/22/2026, 11:40:51 AM, 12:00:44 PM, 12:01:05 PM, and 12:05:26 PM. The significant change was the introduction of `VITE_REACT_APP_TSE_V2_URL = https://tse.travnet.tech/api/v2` at 12:01:05 PM, which was then reverted or corrected to `https://tse.travnet.tech/api/v1` for `VITE_REACT_APP_TSE_V2_URL` at 12:05:26 PM. This file contains sensitive keys and its content details are not further summarized.

In `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightContent\FlightContent.jsx`, multiple saves occurred between 2/22/2026, 11:48:23 AM and 12:00:09 PM. The primary functional change was the addition of `import { Tooltip } from 'flowbite-react';` at 11:54:23 AM. The file defines the `FlightContent` React component responsible for flight search form logic, including state management for journey type, dates, passengers, and validation. It handles departure date changes, airport swapping, and form submission, constructing search parameters for one-way and return journeys.

The styling file `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\assets\modules\Search\Search.css` was updated multiple times between 2/22/2026, 11:50:41 AM and 11:55:12 AM. The key CSS change occurred at 11:51:30 AM, modifying the `flight-container .flight-submitBtn button` rule to add a `hover:shadow-3xl` effect, enhancing the button's interactive styling.

The component `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Search\Sidebar\Flight\AirlinePanel\AirlinePanel.jsx` was logged at 2/22/2026, 12:20:40 PM. This React component renders an airline filter panel within a sidebar, utilizing Ant Design's `Collapse` and a custom `SearchCheckbox` component. It features a "Check All" option and uses `react-custom-scrollbars-2` for a visually enhanced scrollable list of airlines.

For `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightSearch\FlightSearch.jsx`, a change was recorded between 2/22/2026, 12:58:38 PM and 1:54:23 PM. The update at 1:54:23 PM introduced `shallowEqual` to the `useSelector` hook used for `state.flights.filteredFlights`. This optimization helps prevent unnecessary re-renders of the component if the `filteredFlights` array reference doesn't change, even if its internal content is identical. The component itself manages flight search results, including loading states, pagination, sorting, and flight selection to add to a cart.

The Redux slice file `g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\features\Flight\flightsSlice.js` saw updates between 2/22/2026, 1:04:35 PM and 1:06:45 PM. The later timestamp shows the addition of categorized comments for each `createAsyncThunk` function (e.g., `/* ===================== FLIGHTS ===================== */`). More significantly, a new asynchronous thunk `fetchBaggageInfo` was introduced to fetch baggage details for a selected flight. Additionally, the `selectFlight` thunk's `extraReducers` were expanded to include `pending` and `rejected` states, providing more robust loading and error handling for flight selection.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Flight-centric Development:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around flight search, display, filtering, and booking processes.
- **Redux State Management:** Redux is consistently used across `FlightSearch.jsx` and `flightsSlice.js` for managing application state, dispatching actions, and handling asynchronous data fetching. The use of `createAsyncThunk` is prominent for API interactions.
- **Frequent Component Saves:** Several `.jsx` files show multiple timestamps within a short period with identical or very minor changes, suggesting an iterative development workflow with frequent saving.
- **UI Enhancements:** Updates include new imports for UI components (e.g., `Tooltip`) and styling adjustments (e.g., button hover effects), indicating a focus on user experience and visual presentation.
- **API Integration:** The `flightsSlice.js` demonstrates integration with external APIs (TSE endpoints for flight search, airport names, airline names, fare rules, revalidation, and baggage information).
