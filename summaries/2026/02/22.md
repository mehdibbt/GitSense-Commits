# Activity Summary for 2/22/2026

## 12:39:05 PM
The changes log details updates primarily related to the flight search functionality and its associated styling within the `api-client` project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightContent\FlightContent.jsx`**
    *   The core `FlightContent` component underwent significant development starting around **2/22/2026, 11:48:23 AM**. This component manages flight search parameters such as journey type (one-way, return), departure/return dates, airports, passenger counts (adults, children, infants), and cabin class.
    *   Key logic within this file includes state management for these search parameters, date handling (e.g., setting `minDateReturn` and `maxDate` based on departure date), and input value handlers.
    *   The `submitForm` function incorporates robust validation logic, checking for missing departure/return airports, ensuring departure and return airports are not identical, validating date selections, and crucially, ensuring all children's ages are selected if children are included in the search. It also structures the flight search data into `searchAirLegs` objects, populating details like airport codes, names, city, and country for both origin and destination.
    *   At **2/22/2026, 11:54:23 AM**, an import for `Tooltip` from `flowbite-react` was added, suggesting potential UI enhancements or new interactive elements involving tooltips.

*   **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\assets\modules\Search\Search.css`**
    *   Starting from **2/22/2026, 11:50:41 AM**, this CSS file received comprehensive styling updates for various search interface elements. This includes:
        *   Styles for search tabs (`.search-tab-btn`, `.search-tab-headers`, `.search-type`) including active states, font properties, and layout.
        *   Styling for form groups (`.form-group`), inputs, and Ant Design `Select` components, defining their appearance, focus states, and error handling.
        *   Specific styles for flight search sections (`.flight-container`, `.journey-info`, `.traveler-info`, `.cabin-class`), covering layout, passenger input fields, and cabin class dropdowns.
        *   Responsive design adjustments for various screen widths (e.g., `max-width: 424px`, `max-width: 639px`, `max-width: 768px`) to ensure usability across devices.
    *   A minor update at **2/22/2026, 11:51:30 AM** modified the `.flight-container .flight-submitBtn button` style, specifically adding a `hover:shadow-3xl` effect to the existing `shadow-2xl`, enhancing its interactive visual feedback.

*   **`g:\wamp64\www\sitenettech\api-client\src\components\Backend\Search\Sidebar\Flight\AirlinePanel\AirlinePanel.jsx`**
    *   On **2/22/2026, 12:20:40 PM**, the `AirlinePanel` component was introduced or significantly updated. This component is designed for filtering airlines within a sidebar.
    *   It uses Ant Design's `Collapse` component to provide an expandable panel for "AirLines" filtering.
    *   The panel features a "Check All" checkbox and a list of individual airline checkboxes, managed by `SearchCheckbox` components.
    *   Custom scrollbar implementation using `react-custom-scrollbars-2` is in place for the list of airlines, with specific styling for the scrollbar thumb and track.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Concentrated Development Time**: All significant changes occurred on **2/22/2026**, primarily between 11:48 AM and 12:20 PM, indicating a focused work session on the flight search features.
*   **Flight Search Module Focus**: The updates are consistently centered around enhancing the flight search functionality, encompassing the main search form, its styling, and sidebar filtering capabilities.
*   **UI/UX Improvement**: The changes show a strong emphasis on user interface and experience, including form validation, visual feedback (e.g., button hover effects), and responsive design.
*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The use of React components (`FlightContent`, `AirlinePanel`) along with various UI libraries (`@headlessui/react`, `@mui/material`, `antd`, `flowbite-react`) highlights a component-driven development approach.
*   **Repetitive Saves**: Multiple identical code entries for `FlightContent.jsx` and `Search.css` with slightly differing timestamps suggest frequent saves during active development without major functional changes between those specific log entries.
