# Activity Summary for 8/27/2025

## 1:29:54 PM
The log shows two revisions of `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\features\Cart\CartSlice.js`, a Redux slice managing a shopping cart.  The first revision (12:53:54 PM) initializes a cart with a unique ID,  a timer (30 minutes), and handles adding, removing, and loading cart items from sessionStorage.  It allows only one flight in the cart.  The cart total items are recalculated after each addition or removal.

The second revision (12:54:06 PM), made only one minute later, includes minor formatting changes and updates the `loadCartFromSession` reducer to correctly calculate `cartTotalItems` using `reduce`,  previously it was only counting the number of event types.  The comment in `addEventToCart` was also slightly improved for clarity.  No significant functional changes were introduced beyond this correction.  Both versions extensively use `sessionStorage` to persist cart data. The cart expires after 30 minutes of inactivity.  The `events` object within the cart state stores items categorized by event type (Flight, Hotel, etc.).  Recurring elements include consistent use of `sessionStorage` for persistence and the recalculation of `cartTotalItems` after modifications.
