# Activity Summary for 8/25/2025

## 1:25:32 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `CartPage.jsx` between 12:40 PM and 12:55 PM on August 25, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, displaying a shopping cart for flight bookings, remains consistent. However, several key changes occurred:

Initially, the code lacked a `fetchCompanyData` function. This function was added around 12:42 PM, initially with a typo (`cosnt` instead of `const`) and then corrected. The function fetches data from a Supabase 'companies' table using a `company_id`.  The fetched data is initially stored in `fetchCompanyData` state variable and then  renamed to `CompanyData` around 12:43 PM, indicating a change in variable naming convention for better clarity. The  `select` clause in `fetchCompanyData` changed from `'*'` to  `'price_rules'` around 12:46 PM, focusing on retrieving only pricing rules.

Around 12:45 PM,  `company_id` is correctly extracted from the `user` object within `CartPage`, making the fetching of company data dynamic and dependent on the logged-in user.  Before this, `company_id` was undefined, causing the `fetchCompanyData` function to fail implicitly.

Between 12:55 PM and 12:55:48 PM, a `FlightPriceDetails` component was introduced (although not fully implemented).  This strongly suggests an intention to refactor the price calculation logic to incorporate company-specific pricing rules (`flight_fixed`, `flight_percentage`) fetched from Supabase. The commented-out code within the `FlightPriceDetails` component shows calculations for commission on adult, child and infant tickets, demonstrating the aim of this refactoring. The final commit at 12:55:48 PM shows the commented-out code for calculating and displaying flight prices with commission is removed in favor of the original implementation.

In summary, the main evolution was the integration of company-specific pricing rules into the cart display. This involved adding a function to fetch this data, fixing a typo, improving variable naming, and finally adding and then removing a component to handle price calculations based on the fetched data. The ultimate change at 12:55:48 PM simply shows the original price calculation and display was favored.
