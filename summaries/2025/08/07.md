## 1:39:06 PM
The log shows several modifications across multiple files, primarily focused on styling and the `ForgetPassword` component.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\assets\modules\form.css`:** This file underwent multiple updates throughout the day,  primarily adjusting styling for form elements.  Changes include modifications to `form__control` padding (from `px-4` to `px-5` and finally `px-6`),  the addition of styling for icons within form groups (`form_group svg`), and the creation of a new `input_field` class to improve the layout of input elements. The most significant change happened at 12:51:00 PM.


**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\auth\ForgetPasswordPage.jsx`:** This file had a single update at 11:48:08 AM, which involved a simple import and export of the `ForgetPassword` component to use it within an `AuthLayout`.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\routes\AppRoutes.jsx`:** This file was updated once at 11:48:22 AM.  The update involved adding the `ForgetPasswordPage` route to the application's routing configuration. This route directs users to the password reset page. No other substantial changes were noted.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Auth\ForgetPassword.jsx`:**  This component underwent extensive revisions between 11:48:35 AM and 12:53:38 PM.  The initial version included a detailed header with contributor information. Subsequent changes focused on:

* **UI Improvements:**  The styling was refined multiple times, removing unnecessary classes and using more concise Tailwind CSS syntax.  The main heading's text was changed from "Forget Password?" to "Enter your email," reflecting a functional shift. The button label was changed from "Send Email" to "Login to your account". The "Sign Up" link text was altered to "Create an Account".
* **Component Replacement:** The standard HTML input was replaced with a custom `Input` component for better styling and functionality.  This included adding icons (a mail icon for email input).
* **API Endpoint:**  The API endpoint used in `EmailSendHandeller` remained consistently set to `/login` throughout all modifications, though the functionality may change, suggesting a potential inconsistency.  Consider reviewing the `/login` endpoint to ensure proper functionality for the forget password flow, as this component currently uses the login endpoint.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Auth\Login.jsx`:**  This component was also updated, adding icons to the `Input` components for email and password fields (`FaRegEnvelope` and `MdOutlineLock`) at 12:34:44 PM and adjusting the icon size for the password icon at 12:36:23 PM.  Finally, no other significant changes were observed.  No changes were made to the login functionality itself, though it should be reviewed for consistency with the `/login` endpoint used in the `ForgetPassword` component.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\UI\Input\Input.jsx`:** This component was updated once at 12:41:11 PM and again at 12:40:48 PM.  The change involves adding a `input_field` div for better styling and positioning.

In summary, the majority of the changes focused on improving the UI/UX of the `ForgetPassword` component and adding icons to form fields. The repeated changes to the `form.css` file indicate ongoing styling adjustments.  A potential issue is the use of the `/login` endpoint in the `ForgetPassword` component; the endpoint should be reviewed to ensure correct functionality.
