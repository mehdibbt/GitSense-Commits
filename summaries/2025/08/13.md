# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

The provided log shows changes to two files within a React application related to flight search functionality.  Both modifications occurred on August 13, 2025.


`FlightSearch.jsx`: This component displays flight search results. The most significant update at 1:20:59 PM involves refining the UI for displaying flight results. Changes include improved styling (using Tailwind CSS classes),  the addition of a loading indicator (`SearchLoader`), and clearer separation of UI elements  (Sidebar, AirSegments, FlightPrice). The component fetches flight data, handles pagination, and allows users to select flights. The `selectFlightHandeller` function dispatches a Redux action to select a flight and potentially navigate to a flight details page. The code also includes functions to fetch and handle fare rules.


`flightsSlice.js`: This Redux slice manages flight data.  Updates at 1:27:41 PM and 1:29:54 PM  primarily focus on asynchronous thunks for fetching flight data, airlines, and airports. The `fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, and `fetchAirlines` thunks use `axios` to make API calls. The `fetchFlighstData` thunk chains these calls, first fetching flights and then using the results to fetch related airlines.   The `selectFlight` thunk now handles selecting a flight and sending the relevant data to revalidate prices. A noticeable difference between the two timestamps for this file is a slight modification in the `selectFlight` thunk, specifically in how it retrieves fare rules from the Redux store. The initial version at 1:27:41 PM had a flawed approach to accessing `fareRules`, which was corrected at 1:29:54 PM.  Both versions show a reliance on  `axiosTseInstance` for certain API calls, suggesting a specific interaction with a Travel Service Engine (TSE) API.  The slice includes reducers for managing loading states, errors, and updating various pieces of flight-related data in the Redux store.
