# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 12:43:07 PM
The log shows two Redux slices implemented using `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

The first slice, `flightsSlice.js`,  modified at 11:59:05 AM on August 17, 2025, manages flight data.  It uses asynchronous thunks (`createAsyncThunk`) to fetch flights, airports, and airlines from various APIs (some using `axios`, others `axiosTseInstance`).  The `fetchFlights` thunk retrieves flight fares; `fetchAirports` and `fetchAirlines` fetch airport and airline data respectively, often based on carrier codes extracted from the flight data.  A combined thunk, `fetchFlighstData`, orchestrates fetching flights and airlines concurrently.  The slice includes reducers for managing loading states, errors, and various flight-related data like `filteredFlights`, `selectedFlight`, and `fareRules`.  A notable feature is the handling of fare rules, which involves a separate `fetchFareRules` thunk that retrieves detailed fare information. The `selectFlight` thunk handles selecting a flight and revalidating its price.


The second slice, `CartSlice.js`, modified at 12:08:14 PM on August 17, 2025, manages shopping cart data. It persists the cart to localStorage with an expiry time of 30 minutes. The slice includes reducers for initializing a basket ID, adding various travel items (flights, hotels, transfers, attractions), setting a timer, and clearing the cart.  The cart data includes `basketId`, `flight`, `hotel`, `transfers`, `attractions`, `cartTotal`, `event` (indicating the type of item added), and `cartTimer`.  Helper functions `loadCart` and `saveCart` handle local storage interactions.


## 2:43:09 PM
The log shows iterative development of a flight search and shopping cart feature within a React application using Redux toolkit.

`CartSlice.js` underwent several revisions between 1:55 PM and 2:07 PM.  Initially, the cart included fields for `userId`, `companyUid`, and `dollarConversion`.  These were later removed, simplifying the state to `basketId`, `events` (an object storing flight, hotel, etc. details), `cartTotal`, `multipleItems`, `currency`, and a `timer`.  Significant changes include the introduction of `sessionStorage` to persist cart data across sessions, and a shift from `initCart` to `initializeBasket` for basket initialization.  The `addEventToCart` reducer now stores data in `sessionStorage`.  The  `clearCart` action also cleans up session storage.  The final version of `CartSlice.js` remained consistent for a few commits.

`FlightSearch.jsx` was modified between 2:04 PM and 2:13 PM. The most significant change is the integration of the updated `CartSlice` actions (`initializeBasket` and `addEventToCart`) into the `selectFlightHandeller` function. This function now adds selected flight data to the cart after initializing the basket. The navigation path after adding flight to cart is changed from `/cart` to `/admin/cart`.  There are also minor code style changes and comments throughout.  The import statements for the cart slice changed between versions.  The `getInitialAvailStrings` function appears to process flight availability data, but its logic remains consistent across revisions.

`store.js` was updated at 2:08 PM. The primary change involved disabling the `serializableCheck` middleware in Redux to address potential conflicts (possibly due to the data structure of the flight data).

In summary, the development focused on enhancing the shopping cart functionality by adding session persistence and refining the flight selection process to seamlessly add flights to the cart and then redirect to the cart page.  The changes follow a pattern of incremental improvement and bug fixing, with a focus on integrating the cart and flight search components.


## 4:43:18 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `Header.jsx` and `FlatHeader.jsx` components, and the `CartSlice.js` reducer,  all related to a shopping cart feature within a React application.  There are also changes to the `CartPage.jsx` component and a custom hook `useCartTimer.js`.  The updates span from 3:48 PM to 4:37 PM on August 17, 2025.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\include\Header\Header.jsx`**:

This file underwent several revisions, primarily focused on debugging and potentially refactoring.  Initial versions included a full header component with user profile, cart display, and menu functionality. The `cartTotal`, `timer`, and `expired` state variables are consistently used to manage the cart.  A significant change around 3:49 PM involved adding console logging statements for debugging cart-related variables.  A later edit at 3:50 PM moved the `console.log` statement to be inside the `useEffect` hook for the timer.  Subsequently, the component was drastically simplified, removing almost all of its rendering logic, at 3:50 and 3:51 PM, before being restored to its original form with minor styling adjustments at 3:52 PM.  The final version closely resembles the first.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\include\Header\FlatHeader.jsx`**:

This file also underwent significant changes, primarily involving the addition of cart-related functionality mirroring that in `Header.jsx`.  The initial version (3:53 PM) is a responsive header with a drawer menu.  A series of updates between 3:54 PM and 3:57 PM progressively added the Redux logic for interacting with the cart, mirroring the `Header.jsx` changes. These updates include importing `useDispatch`, `useSelector`,  `loadCartFromSession`, and `shallowEqual` from `react-redux` and integrating the cart display and timer into the component. The final version at 4:37 PM includes these cart additions and remains largely consistent with previous versions.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\features\Cart\CartSlice.js`**:

This Redux slice manages the cart state.  The initial version (4:01 PM) uses `sessionStorage` to persist cart data and implements actions to initialize the cart, load it from sessionStorage, decrement the timer, and clear the cart.  The most significant change happened between 4:02 PM and 4:07 PM. It involved adding the `addEventToCart` action to add items to the cart.  The timer was also modified to track time in seconds rather than minutes. The cart's `events` object was restructured to hold events by type (e.g., Flight, Hotel).  The `loadCartFromSession` action was significantly improved to handle timer expiry more gracefully, removing the cart's contents in case of expiry.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Search\CartPage.jsx`**:

This page displays the cart's contents. Initially rendering the cart items directly (4:17 PM), it evolves to incorporate a more robust rendering structure using a separate component, `CartItemList` (4:26 PM onwards). The updates from 4:17PM to 4:20PM show the debugging effort done for the cart items, refining how the cart data is accessed from the redux store. The final version (4:35 PM) correctly imports components and uses the custom hook for timer display.

**`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\hooks\cart\useCartTimer.js`**:

This custom hook manages the cart timer. It uses `sessionStorage` to read the expiry time and provides the remaining time in minutes and seconds.  The changes at 4:36 PM removed the dependency on Redux for the `expireCart` action and instead returns time in seconds.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

The consistent use of `sessionStorage` for persisting cart data, a timer mechanism to expire the cart after 30 minutes, and Redux for managing state are key patterns across the code changes. The frequent use of `useEffect` hooks for managing side effects, such as loading from sessionStorage and updating the timer, is also notable.  The multiple revisions to `Header.jsx` show iterative debugging and refactoring steps, suggesting that the development process involved frequent adjustments and improvements to the cart feature's implementation.  The changes in the `CartSlice` demonstrate a change in data structure and improved logic for handling cart expiration.
