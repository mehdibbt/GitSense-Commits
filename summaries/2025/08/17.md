# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 12:43:07 PM
The log shows two Redux slices implemented using `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

The first slice, `flightsSlice.js`,  modified at 11:59:05 AM on August 17, 2025, manages flight data.  It uses asynchronous thunks (`createAsyncThunk`) to fetch flights, airports, and airlines from various APIs (some using `axios`, others `axiosTseInstance`).  The `fetchFlights` thunk retrieves flight fares; `fetchAirports` and `fetchAirlines` fetch airport and airline data respectively, often based on carrier codes extracted from the flight data.  A combined thunk, `fetchFlighstData`, orchestrates fetching flights and airlines concurrently.  The slice includes reducers for managing loading states, errors, and various flight-related data like `filteredFlights`, `selectedFlight`, and `fareRules`.  A notable feature is the handling of fare rules, which involves a separate `fetchFareRules` thunk that retrieves detailed fare information. The `selectFlight` thunk handles selecting a flight and revalidating its price.


The second slice, `CartSlice.js`, modified at 12:08:14 PM on August 17, 2025, manages shopping cart data. It persists the cart to localStorage with an expiry time of 30 minutes. The slice includes reducers for initializing a basket ID, adding various travel items (flights, hotels, transfers, attractions), setting a timer, and clearing the cart.  The cart data includes `basketId`, `flight`, `hotel`, `transfers`, `attractions`, `cartTotal`, `event` (indicating the type of item added), and `cartTimer`.  Helper functions `loadCart` and `saveCart` handle local storage interactions.

The log shows iterative development of a flight search and shopping cart feature within a React application using Redux toolkit.

`CartSlice.js` underwent several revisions between 1:55 PM and 2:07 PM.  Initially, the cart included fields for `userId`, `companyUid`, and `dollarConversion`.  These were later removed, simplifying the state to `basketId`, `events` (an object storing flight, hotel, etc. details), `cartTotal`, `multipleItems`, `currency`, and a `timer`.  Significant changes include the introduction of `sessionStorage` to persist cart data across sessions, and a shift from `initCart` to `initializeBasket` for basket initialization.  The `addEventToCart` reducer now stores data in `sessionStorage`.  The  `clearCart` action also cleans up session storage.  The final version of `CartSlice.js` remained consistent for a few commits.

`FlightSearch.jsx` was modified between 2:04 PM and 2:13 PM. The most significant change is the integration of the updated `CartSlice` actions (`initializeBasket` and `addEventToCart`) into the `selectFlightHandeller` function. This function now adds selected flight data to the cart after initializing the basket. The navigation path after adding flight to cart is changed from `/cart` to `/admin/cart`.  There are also minor code style changes and comments throughout.  The import statements for the cart slice changed between versions.  The `getInitialAvailStrings` function appears to process flight availability data, but its logic remains consistent across revisions.

`store.js` was updated at 2:08 PM. The primary change involved disabling the `serializableCheck` middleware in Redux to address potential conflicts (possibly due to the data structure of the flight data).

In summary, the development focused on enhancing the shopping cart functionality by adding session persistence and refining the flight selection process to seamlessly add flights to the cart and then redirect to the cart page.  The changes follow a pattern of incremental improvement and bug fixing, with a focus on integrating the cart and flight search components.
