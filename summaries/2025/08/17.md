# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 12:43:07 PM
The log shows two Redux slices implemented using `@reduxjs/toolkit`.

The first slice, `flightsSlice.js`,  modified at 11:59:05 AM on August 17, 2025, manages flight data.  It uses asynchronous thunks (`createAsyncThunk`) to fetch flights, airports, and airlines from various APIs (some using `axios`, others `axiosTseInstance`).  The `fetchFlights` thunk retrieves flight fares; `fetchAirports` and `fetchAirlines` fetch airport and airline data respectively, often based on carrier codes extracted from the flight data.  A combined thunk, `fetchFlighstData`, orchestrates fetching flights and airlines concurrently.  The slice includes reducers for managing loading states, errors, and various flight-related data like `filteredFlights`, `selectedFlight`, and `fareRules`.  A notable feature is the handling of fare rules, which involves a separate `fetchFareRules` thunk that retrieves detailed fare information. The `selectFlight` thunk handles selecting a flight and revalidating its price.


The second slice, `CartSlice.js`, modified at 12:08:14 PM on August 17, 2025, manages shopping cart data. It persists the cart to localStorage with an expiry time of 30 minutes. The slice includes reducers for initializing a basket ID, adding various travel items (flights, hotels, transfers, attractions), setting a timer, and clearing the cart.  The cart data includes `basketId`, `flight`, `hotel`, `transfers`, `attractions`, `cartTotal`, `event` (indicating the type of item added), and `cartTimer`.  Helper functions `loadCart` and `saveCart` handle local storage interactions.
