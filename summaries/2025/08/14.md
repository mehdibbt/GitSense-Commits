# Activity Summary for 8/14/2025

## 1:38:46 PM
The log shows multiple updates to components within a React application, primarily focusing on a `DashboardPanel` and `FlightContent` component, and a `ComboSearchInput` component.

**`DashboardPanel.jsx` (Multiple Updates):** This component underwent numerous revisions between 12:44 PM and 12:53 PM.  The core functionality remained consistent: displaying a panel with an icon, title, and numerical value.  Changes focused on the `console.log` statement, initially logging just the `value`, then the `title` and `value`, and finally refining the conditional rendering of the `value` to handle null or undefined values gracefully using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) and ensuring a 0 is displayed if the value is null or undefined.  The final change removed redundant conditional rendering for the title.

**`CrmResource.jsx` (Two Updates):** This component, which uses multiple `DashboardPanel` components, was updated at 12:48 PM and 12:51 PM. The significant change involved replacing  `dashboardData?.data?.TotalFolder` with  `dashboardData?.data?.TotalClient` in the first `DashboardPanel`, correcting the data source for the client count.

**`FolderGraphCompany.jsx` (Two Updates):** This component, displaying a bar chart, was updated at 12:52 PM and 12:53 PM. The only change was a minor formatting adjustment, moving the `<Bar>` component to its own line.  The component fetches data from `/folders-company-graph` endpoint and renders a bar chart showing payable, sell, buy and commission data for three months.

**`main.jsx` (Two Updates):** This file, responsible for rendering the main application, was updated at 12:56 PM and 12:57 PM. The main change was the removal of the `<React.StrictMode>` component, which is likely an optimization or debugging change.

**`FlightContent.jsx` (Multiple Updates):**  This component was significantly modified between 1:01 PM and 1:32 PM.  This component handles a flight search form.  The updates involved adding extensive error handling and more robust data handling for the flight search parameters.  The changes focused on refining the structure and functionality of the flight search form, including more descriptive variable names and improved data formatting. The `submitForm` function constructs a detailed `searchParam` object, saves relevant data to `sessionStorage`, and navigates to the `/admin/flight-search` route with the search parameters.


**`ComboSearchInput.jsx` (Two Updates):** The `ComboSearchInput` component was initially commented out, then replaced with a refactored version between 1:14 PM and 1:18 PM. The major change is a shift from a direct fetch call within the component to a more flexible design that uses a prop (`apiFetchMap`) to specify the appropriate API call based on the `serviceType`. This change promotes reusability and reduces redundancy.  The commented-out version also referenced an environment variable, which was removed from the functional version.
