## 1:15:36 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `Segment.jsx` and `Search.css`, and  `CartPage.jsx`.


`Segment.jsx` (Multiple Revisions): This React component displays flight segment details.  The changes between 12:35:02 PM and 12:42:54 PM primarily involve minor adjustments to the component's styling and layout using Tailwind CSS classes.  The most significant change is the removal of the departure date display at 12:40:42 PM, followed by its re-addition at 12:41:05 PM, and then its removal again at 12:42:54 PM.  Importantly, the `dayjs` library was added to handle date formatting at 12:35:21 PM.


`Search.css` (Multiple Revisions): This CSS file styles various elements within a flight search interface. The updates between 12:38:29 PM and 12:43:26 PM appear to be refinements to existing styles, focusing on visual aspects like shadows, colors, text sizes, and spacing using Tailwind CSS classes and inline styles. No major structural changes are observed; instead, minor adjustments and commented-out code suggest iterative styling improvements.


`CartPage.jsx` (Multiple Revisions): This React component renders a shopping cart page for flight bookings.  The changes between 1:01:04 PM and 1:15:01 PM involve building the structure and displaying cart items. The initial version shows a placeholder.  Subsequent commits (starting around 1:05:02 PM) progressively add functionality to display flight details using the `AirSegments` component,  and a price summary section.  The price formatting function `priceFormattor` is imported at 1:08:14 PM.  Conditional rendering is implemented to handle empty carts and potential errors. A crucial update at 1:15:01 PM adds conditional rendering for the price details section, ensuring it only appears when flight data is available.
