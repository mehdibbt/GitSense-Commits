# Activity Summary for 8/18/2025

## 1:07:23 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the `CartPage.jsx` component, enhancing its display of flight information within a shopping cart.  Initially, `CartPage.jsx` contained a generic `CartItemList` component to render cart items (8/18/2025, 12:21:35 PM). This component was subsequently removed (8/18/2025, 12:49:25 PM), replaced by a more specific rendering of flight details using the `AirSegments` component (8/18/2025, 12:53:28 PM and 12:53:36 PM).  The changes at 12:53 PM specifically integrate the `AirSegments` component to display flight information if available in the `events.Flight` object within the Redux store.  The cart expiration handling was also modified, removing the immediate display of an "expired" message, instead relying on the cart timer logic and potentially clearing the cart based on the session timer in `useCartTimer.js`

A new component `CartTimer.jsx` was added (8/18/2025, 12:57:12 PM),  providing a visual timer displaying the remaining time before cart expiration. The `useCartTimer.js` hook (updated at 8/18/2025, 12:56:49 PM) manages the cart timer, clearing the cart via a Redux action (`clearCart`) when the timer expires.  This hook uses `sessionStorage` to store cart expiry information.  All updates to `CartPage.jsx` happened within a short period (between 12:21 PM and 12:53 PM), suggesting a focused development effort on improving the flight information display within the cart. The final version of `CartPage.jsx` displays cart items only if `cartTotal` is greater than 0.  If `cartTotal` is 0, it displays "Your cart is empty".
