# Activity Summary for 8/10/2025

## 1:39:58 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `AuthLayout.jsx` and `form.css`.

**AuthLayout.jsx:** This component, a React layout for authentication pages, underwent several revisions between 12:48 PM and 1:14 PM on August 10, 2025. The main changes focused on the styling of the image and text within the layout. Specifically, the height and width of the image wrapper were adjusted repeatedly (`img-wrapper` class). The large heading text ("All in one travel solutions") was initially on a single line, then broken into multiple lines using `<br/>` tags, and finally the text itself was removed, leaving only the image. Finally a `shadow-lg` class was added for the image wrapper.  These changes suggest iterative design adjustments.


**form.css:** This file, containing CSS styles for forms, received updates between 12:55 PM and 12:56 PM on August 10, 2025.  The modifications involved adding a `transition duration-300` class to the `.form__control` class,  and removing `focus:ring-primaryBlue` from the `.form__control` selector while retaining `focus:border-primaryBlue`. These changes likely aimed at improving the visual appearance and transitions of form elements.  There were also minor adjustments in the structure of the CSS, but without changes in functionality. The `form.css` file contains styling for various form elements such as checkboxes, input fields, and date range pickers.


## 3:39:56 PM
The log shows a single code update to `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Auth\ForgetPassword.jsx` on August 10, 2025, at 3:37:14 PM.  This file contains a React component for a "Forget Password" functionality.  The component uses Axios to send a POST request to `/login` with the user's email.  The response is handled to display success or error messages. The component includes input validation, loading states, and links to other pages for account creation. The code is well-commented, including author and project information.  The POST request to `/login` is noteworthy, as it might be a potential security vulnerability if not designed carefully to handle password resets rather than direct logins.  The component uses several custom UI components (Alert, Button, Input).


## 4:40:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `ForgetPassword.jsx` between 3:40 PM and 4:11 PM on August 10, 2025, focusing on the password reset functionality.  Initially, the component used Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail` function with a redirect, which was later removed.  Then there was a switch back and forth between using Supabase directly and attempting to use Axios (commented-out code).  Finally, the code settled on using Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail`, adding client-side email validation (checking for empty fields and valid email format) using a regular expression within the `EmailSendHandeller` function. Minor UI changes include adjusting the spacing around Alert components.


The `TaskEdit.jsx` file was updated once at 4:37 PM on August 10, 2025. This component is a significantly more complex React component for editing tasks. It uses various libraries (Ant Design, Formik, Primereact, React Router, etc.), interacts with a backend API (`axiosInstanceV1`), and utilizes Supabase for data updates. The update includes a  follow/unfollow feature, a JSON modal, tabs for notes and logs, and a collapsible section for editing task details. The component dynamically renders input fields based on data fetched from the server (`editFieldInfo`), indicating a flexible, potentially admin-configurable UI.  The data fetching utilizes `fetchEditDataWithAdminSettings` which suggests an admin-controlled configuration for task fields.
