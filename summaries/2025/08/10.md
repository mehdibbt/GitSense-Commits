# Activity Summary for 8/10/2025

## 1:39:58 PM
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `AuthLayout.jsx` and `form.css`.

**AuthLayout.jsx:** This component, a React layout for authentication pages, underwent several revisions between 12:48 PM and 1:14 PM on August 10, 2025. The main changes focused on the styling of the image and text within the layout. Specifically, the height and width of the image wrapper were adjusted repeatedly (`img-wrapper` class). The large heading text ("All in one travel solutions") was initially on a single line, then broken into multiple lines using `<br/>` tags, and finally the text itself was removed, leaving only the image. Finally a `shadow-lg` class was added for the image wrapper.  These changes suggest iterative design adjustments.


**form.css:** This file, containing CSS styles for forms, received updates between 12:55 PM and 12:56 PM on August 10, 2025.  The modifications involved adding a `transition duration-300` class to the `.form__control` class,  and removing `focus:ring-primaryBlue` from the `.form__control` selector while retaining `focus:border-primaryBlue`. These changes likely aimed at improving the visual appearance and transitions of form elements.  There were also minor adjustments in the structure of the CSS, but without changes in functionality. The `form.css` file contains styling for various form elements such as checkboxes, input fields, and date range pickers.
