# Activity Summary for 8/31/2025

## 12:14:40 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `CartPage.jsx` on August 31st, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is refining the display and calculation of flight price details within a shopping cart.

Initially, the code includes functions to fetch company pricing rules from a Supabase database (`fetchCompanyData`), calculate the total price of flights (`calculateFlightBreakdown`, `calculateItemPrice`, `calculateCartTotal`), and render a cart summary.  There's an Accordion component to show/hide detailed price breakdowns.  Early versions included commented-out code for handling expired cart sessions.

Between 11:56 AM and 12:04 PM,  the UI for displaying the flight price breakdown within the Accordion was significantly reworked.  The initial version used a simplified structure; the updated version displays a more detailed breakdown including base fare, tax, and commission (calculated using `calculateItemPrice`), showing each passenger type separately. The formatting also improved with currency symbols and `toFixed(2)` for two decimal places.

Further edits between 12:10 PM and 12:14 PM involved removing certain calculations and then restoring them with minor adjustments. These are likely debugging attempts.  Specifically, lines calculating `currency`, `symbol`, `baseFareTotal`, `taxTotal`, and `subTotal` were repeatedly added and removed or commented out.

Finally, between 12:14 PM and 12:14 PM, a final adjustment was made: the `useEffect` hook which updates the total cart price based on changes in the events was commented out. This suggests the total price calculation logic might have been moved or adjusted elsewhere in the application.  The commented-out `calculateItemPrice` and `calculateCartTotal` functions reflect a possible refactor that hasn't been completed in the log entries.  The core logic of fetching company pricing rules and calculating flight prices remained consistent across all revisions.
