# Activity Summary for 8/31/2025

## 12:14:40 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `CartPage.jsx` on August 31st, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is refining the display and calculation of flight price details within a shopping cart.

Initially, the code includes functions to fetch company pricing rules from a Supabase database (`fetchCompanyData`), calculate the total price of flights (`calculateFlightBreakdown`, `calculateItemPrice`, `calculateCartTotal`), and render a cart summary.  There's an Accordion component to show/hide detailed price breakdowns.  Early versions included commented-out code for handling expired cart sessions.

Between 11:56 AM and 12:04 PM,  the UI for displaying the flight price breakdown within the Accordion was significantly reworked.  The initial version used a simplified structure; the updated version displays a more detailed breakdown including base fare, tax, and commission (calculated using `calculateItemPrice`), showing each passenger type separately. The formatting also improved with currency symbols and `toFixed(2)` for two decimal places.

Further edits between 12:10 PM and 12:14 PM involved removing certain calculations and then restoring them with minor adjustments. These are likely debugging attempts.  Specifically, lines calculating `currency`, `symbol`, `baseFareTotal`, `taxTotal`, and `subTotal` were repeatedly added and removed or commented out.

Finally, between 12:14 PM and 12:14 PM, a final adjustment was made: the `useEffect` hook which updates the total cart price based on changes in the events was commented out. This suggests the total price calculation logic might have been moved or adjusted elsewhere in the application.  The commented-out `calculateItemPrice` and `calculateCartTotal` functions reflect a possible refactor that hasn't been completed in the log entries.  The core logic of fetching company pricing rules and calculating flight prices remained consistent across all revisions.


## 1:14:33 PM
The `CartPage.jsx` component was updated twice on August 31st, 2025.  The key changes involved the calculation and display of flight prices.

The first update at 12:52:13 PM included the initial structure of the `CartPage` component. It fetched company pricing rules from Supabase, displayed cart items (currently only flights), and had a placeholder for calculating the total cart price. The price breakdown for flights was calculated but not fully implemented in the UI.

The second update, at 12:52:46 PM, introduced a significant modification to the `calculateFlightBreakdown` function.  This function now sets the `totalCartPrice` state variable directly within the function.  A `console.log` statement was added to this function to output debugging information.  A minor UI change within the accordion section also occurred, reverting a more detailed passenger price breakdown to a simpler display.  The primary change is the direct update of `totalCartPrice` within `calculateFlightBreakdown`, which may impact the overall price calculation and the component's behavior.  There was no change to how the total cart price was calculated in the  `calculateCartTotal` function, only its invocation point.


## 2:14:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CartPage.jsx` between 1:20 PM and 1:27 PM on August 31, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be commenting out or removing sections of code, particularly those related to:


* **`calculateFlightBreakdown` function:** This function, initially present, underwent several modifications and was eventually entirely commented out. It seems to have been intended for calculating flight costs, possibly using company-specific price rules fetched from the Supabase database using `fetchCompanyData`.  The function's commented-out state suggests it might be undergoing refactoring or is temporarily disabled.

* **Cart Empty State:** The conditional rendering for an empty cart (`if (cartTotalItems === 0)`) was also commented out in later revisions. This suggests a potential change in how an empty cart is handled.

* **`calculateCartTotal` function:** Similar to `calculateFlightBreakdown`, this function was also completely commented out in later revisions, indicating potential refactoring or temporary removal.

* **Expired Cart Handling:**  The logic to handle expired cart sessions (`if (expired)`) was consistently commented out throughout the log, meaning this feature was likely temporarily deactivated.


The `useEffect` hooks, responsible for loading the cart from the session and fetching company data, remained largely unchanged, although the call to `calculateFlightBreakdown` was eventually commented out in the final revision.  The `console.log` statements for `events` and `companyData` were also toggled on and off, suggesting debugging efforts.  The overall UI structure of the `CartPage` component did not experience significant changes throughout these revisions.  The most significant change was the commenting-out of the flight price calculation and cart total calculation functions.  The final revision at 1:27:12 PM shows the  `console.log("companyData ", companyData)` statement was uncommented.


## 3:14:43 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CartPage.jsx` between 2:19 PM and 3:14 PM on August 31, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is improving the display and calculation of flight prices within a shopping cart.

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for handling empty carts and expired sessions, along with incomplete or commented-out functions for calculating flight breakdowns.  The `calculateFlightBreakdown` function underwent significant evolution throughout the revisions.  Early versions attempted to calculate prices based on fixed and percentage-based rules, but these calculations were incomplete or contained logical errors.  Later versions corrected the calculations and added a `commissionPrice` property to the returned breakdown object.  A `clculateFlightTotal` function (with a typographical error in the name) was introduced to calculate the total flight price based on adult, children, infant counts, and the `totalCost` fetched from the flight data.


The `useEffect` hook shows a pattern of fetching company data using `supabase` to retrieve `price_rules`. The `fetchCompanyData` function retrieves pricing rules from the `companies` table in Supabase, based on the user's `company_id`.  Initially, the `useEffect` hook triggered both data fetching and price calculations on mount and on every dispatch.  Subsequent revisions refined this to fetch company data only once, when the user's `company_id` changes. The function to calculate the total flight price is now conditionally called in a separate `useEffect` hook, ensuring it only runs when necessary (events.Flight exists, and companyData has price_rules).


Around 2:34 PM, the code was significantly restructured to improve the display of price details.  A previously commented-out `calculateFlightBreakdown` function was uncommented and implemented properly, to calculate the price details in the Accordion component. This function now maps over `priceDetails`, calculating a `commissionPrice` for each passenger type, improving accuracy and clarifying the calculations.  The `parseInt` function was added for calculating `totalPassenger`,  improving data handling robustness and correcting previous potential type errors.

By 2:54 PM the code implemented an Accordion component to display the passenger price breakdown.  The final version at 3:14 PM shows a fully functional implementation, rendering price details from the `calculateFlightBreakdown` function for each passenger type in an accordion.  The commented-out code for empty cart and expired session handling remains. The unnecessary `calculateCartTotal` function was also removed.

In summary, the evolution of `CartPage.jsx` involved iterative improvements to the flight price calculation logic and a substantial UI overhaul to better present this information to the user using an Accordion. The final version reflects a more robust and user-friendly implementation.


## 4:14:40 PM
The provided log shows multiple revisions to `CartPage.jsx` between 3:14 PM and 4:14 PM on August 31st, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is refining the calculation and display of flight prices in a shopping cart.

Initially, the code included a commented-out section for handling empty carts and expired sessions.  The core logic involved fetching company pricing rules from a Supabase database using the user's `company_id`.  This data (`companyData.price_rules`) is crucial for calculating the final price, incorporating fixed and percentage-based commissions.

The `calculateFlightBreakdown` function underwent significant changes.  It evolved from a commented-out, simpler calculation to a more complex version that iterates through `priceDetails` to compute `commissionPrice` for each passenger type (adult, child, infant), considering both fixed and percentage-based commissions from the fetched company data.  The `adult_commission`, `child_commission`, and `infant_commission` were added to breakdown object in each iteration of the `priceDetails` map.

The `clculateFlightTotal` function (note the typo) calculates the total flight price based on passenger counts (adults, children, infants) and the `companyData.price_rules`.

Several UI updates were also made.  The most apparent changes involved adjustments to text sizes (`.text-base`, `.text-sm`) and colors (`.text[#5A6573]`, `.text-textGray`), likely for improved visual presentation. The spacing in the accordion component was also adjusted using `.gap-1`.  These stylistic changes occurred towards the end of the log, between 4:12 PM and 4:14 PM.  The changes to the text size in the last two commits suggests an attempt to improve the UI readability.  There was also a minor typographical correction in `clculateFlightTotal` function name in the beginning, that was corrected over the course of the changes.  A commented-out section for calculating the overall cart total (`calculateCartTotal`) suggests that future development might involve handling multiple item types beyond flights.

The consistent use of `useEffect` hooks demonstrates a reactive approach to updating the UI based on changes in `events` (cart items) and `companyData` (pricing rules). The overall pattern shows iterative refinement of the flight pricing logic and UI adjustments within a React application integrated with Supabase.
