# Activity Summary for 11/2/2025

## 11:40:09 AM
The development log shows a series of focused updates on November 2, 2025, between 10:49:48 AM and 11:19:55 AM, primarily affecting the booking list functionality within a Supabase-CRM application.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\BookingList.js`**: This file, containing configuration constants for the booking list interface, underwent several precise adjustments. Initially, it defined `bookingListConstant` for flight statuses and task priorities, and `bookingListInfo` detailing table columns (`list_config`), filter fields (`filter_info`), and update fields (`update_info`). Subsequent changes iteratively modified the `columnWidth` properties within `list_config` for several fields:
    *   `status` column width was changed from `12` to `10` (at 11:09:28 AM).
    *   `createdAt` column width was adjusted from `9` to `10` (at 11:10:05 AM).
    *   `company` column width was updated from `6` to `10` (at 11:18:47 AM).
    *   `basketId` column width was first set from `8` to `9` (at 11:19:21 AM) and then immediately to `10` (at 11:19:29 AM).
    These changes indicate a fine-tuning of the layout and presentation of the booking list table.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\hooks\fetch\useFetchCompany.jsx`**: A new or significantly updated React custom hook, `useFetchCompany`, was committed. This hook is responsible for fetching company-related data from a Supabase `companies` table. It specifically queries for `id`, `company_uid`, `company_no`, and `company_name`, and filters the results based on the current user's `mother_company_id`. The hook utilizes `useEffect` to trigger data fetching when the authentication `token` or `comId` changes, and includes error handling.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingList\BookingList.jsx`**: This is a core React component (`BookingList`) responsible for displaying and managing booking records (flights, hotels, transfers, activities) in the CRM. The changes to this file occurred frequently and were largely iterative, suggesting active development and debugging:
    *   The component imports a wide array of utilities, constants (`bookingListInfo`), and UI components.
    *   It manages various local states related to filtering, pagination, table data, and loading.
    *   It defines several helper functions for table column rendering, including `base64Encode` for URL encoding, `basketIdTemplate` (which links to an external system based on user permissions), `updatedDateTemplate` for date formatting, `statusTemplate` for rendering color-coded statuses across different service types, and `clientNameTemplate`.
    *   A `console.log("companies ", companies)` statement was added (at 10:53:28 AM) for debugging the data fetched from `useFetchCompany`, and later commented out or removed in subsequent, largely identical commits.
    *   A significant, though small, functional change was the addition of a `key={key}` prop to the `<p>` element within the `renderStatus` function inside `statusTemplate` (at 11:06:38 AM), addressing a common React list rendering warning.
    The numerous, almost identical commits to this file suggest frequent saving during a period of active development and testing.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Interconnected Development:** Changes in `BookingList.js` (column definitions) directly correlate with the rendering logic in `BookingList.jsx`. The `useFetchCompany` hook is also integrated into the `BookingList.jsx` component.
*   **Table UI/UX Refinement:** A recurring theme is the adjustment of table column widths and the implementation of dynamic column rendering (e.g., external links for basket IDs, color-coded statuses).
*   **Active Debugging/Development:** The frequent saves, the addition of `console.log` statements, and the quick fix for the `key` prop in `BookingList.jsx` indicate an active development session focused on building out and refining the booking list interface.
*   **Core CRM Functionality:** The changes are centered around a "BookingList" component within a "Travnet Tech CRM" project, highlighting core business logic for managing travel bookings.
