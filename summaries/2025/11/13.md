**File-Specific Overview (`BookingDetails.jsx`):**
This React component, `BookingDetails.jsx`, is responsible for displaying comprehensive information about a specific booking.

*   **Imports:** It extensively uses `react-icons` for various UI elements (e.g., `FaHouseChimney`, `MdListAlt`, `AiFillIdcard`, `RiFileTextLine`, `TbCheckupList`, `FaFileInvoiceDollar`), `dayjs` for date handling, `flowbite-react` for tooltips, and `react-router-dom` for navigation. It also imports `supabase` for database interactions and `axiosTseInstance` for API calls.
*   **State Management:** The component manages various states, including `isCollapsed` for UI sections, `pageLoading` for data fetching, `data` for the main booking details, `editFieldInfo` for dynamic field configurations, `folderInvoiceStatus`, and `userData`.
*   **Data Fetching:**
    *   `fetchEditData`: Fetches main booking data using `axiosTseInstance` and the `basketId` from URL parameters.
    *   `userInfo`: Retrieves user details from Supabase based on `data.user_id`.
    *   `getFolderStatus`: Fetches folder-related invoice status from Supabase using a hardcoded `booking_reference` (`'B-16855235'`) in the example, though it intends to use `basketId`.
    *   `useFetchCompany` hook is used to fetch company information.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Displays a breadcrumb navigation (`Home > Booking List > Booking Details`).
    *   Shows booking reference (`basketId`) and order ID (`folderInvoiceStatus?.order_id`).
    *   Includes a "Refresh" button and a "Back" link to the booking list.
    *   Features a collapse/expand functionality for sections, controlled by the `isCollapsed` state and an icon that toggles between `MdExpandLess` and `MdExpandMore`.
    *   Contains commented-out code for tab navigation (`Flight`, `Hotel`, `Attraction`, `Transfer`), indicating potential future or disabled functionality for viewing different types of booking details.
    *   The `pannel-body` is structured using a grid layout, intended to display various fields based on `editFieldInfo`.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
*   **Supabase and Axios Integration:** Consistent use of Supabase for user and folder data, and `axiosTseInstance` for fetching primary booking details from an external API.
*   **UI Component Library:** Reliance on `flowbite-react` (Tooltip) and a wide array of `react-icons` for a rich user interface.
*   **State-driven UI:** Extensive use of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage UI state and data fetching lifecycle.
*   **Context for Permissions:** `useContextAuth` is utilized to access authentication status, user information, and check user permissions.
*   **Referencing Constants:** Constants like `bookingListInfo` and `exportHeader` are imported, indicating a modular approach to configuration and API headers.
