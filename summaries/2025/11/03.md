# Activity Summary for 11/3/2025

## 1:18:03 PM
In the `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingDetails\BookingDetails.jsx` file, a series of incremental changes were applied between 11/3/2025, 12:28:54 PM and 1:03:08 PM, primarily focusing on the visual presentation and layout of the booking details header.

**Key File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Initial State (11/3/2025, 12:28:54 PM):** The `BookingDetails` component was set up with a page header, a display for booking reference (`data?.basketId`), and conditional rendering for folder invoice status (`folderInvoiceStatus?.order_id` and `folderInvoiceStatus?.is_invoice`). It included refresh and back buttons, and a collapse/expand toggle for a content panel.
*   **Styling Refinements (12:29:42 PM - 12:31:04 PM):**
    *   Styling for the `folderInvoiceStatus?.order_id` was adjusted multiple times, moving from `text-green-600 font-medium` to `text-green-600 font-normal text-sm font-semibold`.
    *   The prefix "Order:" was added to the `order_id` display, and the ID itself was later wrapped in `<strong>` tags.
    *   The color class for the order status changed from `text-green-600` to `text-success` and then settled on `text-green-700`.
*   **Enhanced "Invoiced" Status (12:32:22 PM - 12:33:40 PM):**
    *   The `FaExternalLinkAlt` icon was imported and integrated into the "Invoiced" status.
    *   "Invoiced" was converted into a clickable `<a>` tag, indicating it's a link to an external resource, and styled with various flex properties (`display-flex items-center`, `flex flex-row items-center`) and text colors/sizes. Minor corrections to class names (`ga` removed, `gap-` corrected to `gap-2`) were made during this period.
*   **Header Layout Adjustments (12:34:41 PM - 12:55:47 PM):**
    *   The `headingInfo__left` section, containing the page title and status information, underwent significant restructuring. Elements were moved, nested, and re-ordered multiple times within `div` wrappers to achieve the desired responsive layout.
    *   The `gap` between elements in `headingInfo__left` was reduced from `gap-8` to `gap-2` and then to `gap-1`.
    *   Flex properties on the main `details-heading` and `headingInfo__left` were adjusted (e.g., removing `!important` modifiers, changing `items-center` to `items-start`, and setting `flex-col` for vertical arrangement).
*   **Consistent Status Styling (1:00:40 PM - 1:03:08 PM):**
    *   The "Referrence" span's text size was changed to `text-sm` and then to `text-xs`, with `text-slate-600` and `font-medium` applied.
    *   The `Referrence`, `Order`, and `Invoiced` status displays were grouped into a single `div` with `flex flex-row gap-2 items-center`.
    *   Styling for "Order:" and "Invoiced" was harmonized with "Referrence:", changing their green, medium-sized text to `text-xs text-slate-600 font-medium` for a more consistent appearance.
    *   The gap between these grouped status elements was slightly increased to `gap-3`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Tailwind CSS usage:** The developer consistently uses Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling (e.g., `flex`, `md:flex-row`, `items-center`, `gap-X`, `text-color-shade`, `font-weight`, `text-size`).
*   **Component Structure:** The component uses React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`) and integrates with external libraries like `flowbite-react` (Tooltip) and `react-icons` (various icons).
*   **Supabase and Axios Integration:** The component fetches `folderStatus` from Supabase and `booking details` using `axiosTseInstance`, indicating data fetching from a backend.
*   **User Permission Check:** The `hasPermission('folder-create')` check is used to conditionally render parts of the UI related to invoicing, suggesting role-based access control.
*   **Iterative Design:** There's a clear pattern of continuous refinement, especially in CSS styling and HTML layout, often involving small adjustments to `gap`, `font-size`, and flexbox properties to achieve the desired visual alignment and spacing. Several changes revert or correct previous ones, indicating an iterative development process.
