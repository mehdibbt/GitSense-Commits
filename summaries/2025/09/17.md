# Activity Summary for 9/17/2025

## 2:02:55 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `FlightPassengerInfo.jsx` and `CartPage.jsx` on September 17, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on improving the passenger information form within the `CartPage`.

**`FlightPassengerInfo.jsx` Changes:**

The most significant updates to `FlightPassengerInfo.jsx` involved a substantial restructuring of the component between 1:07 PM and 1:37 PM. Initially, the component used `FieldArray` from Formik to manage passenger information.  This was then replaced with a direct mapping over `formik.values.passengers.adults`, `formik.values.passengers.children`, and `formik.values.passengers.infants`.  This change simplified the rendering logic and integrated more tightly with Formik's `handleChange` and `setFieldValue` mechanisms.  The changes also improved the naming conventions and structure of the form fields, making them more consistent. The use of `formik.handleChange` was added to several input fields.  Additionally, default values of `undefined` were added to several select components to ensure placeholders displayed correctly.

**`CartPage.jsx` Changes:**

`CartPage.jsx` underwent revisions between 1:11 PM and 1:56 PM. The major change was a significant update to the `validationSchema` within the `useFormik` hook.  The schema was changed to accommodate the new structure of the `passengers` data in `FlightPassengerInfo.jsx`, utilizing nested `Yup.object` and `Yup.array` structures to validate the passenger details, including contact information.  This improved data validation and ensured that all required fields were appropriately checked before submission.  There were no substantial changes to the UI components within `CartPage.jsx`.  The `buildInitialPassengers` function was modified to return an object with separate arrays for adults, children, and infants to align with the `FlightPassengerInfo` component's changes.


The overall pattern suggests a refactoring effort to improve the passenger information form's structure, usability, and data validation.  The changes are iterative, with each revision building upon the previous one to achieve a more robust and maintainable codebase.  The frequent updates indicate a focused development period.
