# Activity Summary for 9/1/2025

## 1:05:00 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CartPage.jsx` on September 1st, 2025, between 12:55 PM and 1:04 PM.  The core functionality remains consistent: fetching company pricing rules from a Supabase database, displaying flight details from a Redux store (`state.cart.events`), and calculating the total flight price, incorporating company-specific pricing rules.

The changes primarily focus on the UI, specifically the layout and styling within the `CartPage` component.  Early revisions involved adding or adjusting CSS classes to improve the visual presentation of flight details and the price breakdown accordion.  The "passenger info" section was initially added as a placeholder text, then refined to become a styled `<h3>` heading, eventually within a `div` with the `title__header` class.  The styling involved adding classes like `flex`, `flex-col`, `justify-between`, `w-full`, `px-3`, `my-2`,  `rounded-lg`, `shadow-lg`,  `bg-white`, and using Tailwind CSS utility classes for spacing, layout, and styling.  The changes also involved improving the visual hierarchy and adding padding for better readability. A `div` with class `title__header` was also added to better structure the heading.

Between 12:55:01 PM and 1:03:20 PM there were many minor revisions adjusting the layout and styling of the passenger info section.  A final notable structural change happened around 1:01 PM, where the passenger information section was moved from being immediately after the `AirSegments` component to being a separate section below it, still within the same container.  The primary focus throughout the changes remains consistently on improving the UI of the cart page.  The core logic for price calculation and data fetching remained unchanged.
