# Activity Summary for 9/23/2025

## 1:19:15 PM
The log shows code changes across two files on September 23, 2025.

**File: `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\supabase\functions\openai\index.ts`**

This file, a Deno function, interacts with the OpenAI API.  Two revisions are recorded. The key change between the revisions (12:27:09 PM and 12:47:15 PM) is the replacement of a hardcoded OpenAI API key with a dynamically retrieved key using `Deno.env.get("openai_api_key")`. This improves security by preventing the API key from being directly exposed in the code. The function handles API requests, verifies authorization headers (though JWT verification is optional), and returns AI responses or error messages.

**File: `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightContent\FlightContent.jsx`**

This React component is a flight search form.  Multiple revisions occurred between 12:56:01 PM and 1:11:06 PM.  These changes primarily involve refinements and additions to the flight search functionality. There is no significant algorithmic change, but the following are notable:

*   The component uses various UI libraries like `@headlessui/react`, `@mui/material`, and `antd`.
*   Extensive JSDoc comments are present, which is good for maintainability.
*   The `submitForm` function formats the date, constructs the search parameters, saves data to `sessionStorage`, and navigates to a flight search results page using `react-router-dom`.
*   Multiple helper functions are defined for date handling, airport switching, and passenger count adjustments.
*   There is commented-out code, suggesting iterative development and potential removal of some features.  Specifically, the `setChildController` and `setInfantController` functions seem to have been removed in favor of the functionality in `setAdultController`.
*   The component incorporates a `useAuth` hook, likely for authentication purposes.
*  The UI library changes between headlessui and antd components are also notable (Specifically the use of Popover).


The changes in the `FlightContent.jsx` file show a continuous refinement of the flight search component. The evolution showcases iterative development, with comments indicating features that were tried and then potentially abandoned or refactored. The consistent use of JSDoc comments indicates a focus on code readability and maintainability.
