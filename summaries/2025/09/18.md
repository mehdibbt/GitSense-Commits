# Activity Summary for 9/18/2025

## 1:48:20 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CartPage.jsx` and `CartContact.jsx` on September 18th, 2025, between 1:12 PM and 1:46 PM.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the functionality and styling of a shopping cart page and its associated contact form.


`CartPage.jsx`:  The major updates in `CartPage.jsx` involve calculations related to flight pricing, incorporating company-specific price rules fetched from a Supabase database.  Several `useEffect` hooks manage data fetching and calculations based on user information, cart events, and company data.  There's also initial setup for passenger information, which appears to be a form, although the validation schema is commented out. The code includes functions to calculate flight breakdowns and totals based on passenger type and company pricing rules.  The repeated use of `parseFloat` suggests conversions from string to numeric types are necessary.  The final revision shows no significant changes from the previous ones.


`CartContact.jsx`: This file represents a contact form component within the cart page.  Changes primarily revolved around improving form handling and error displays using Formik. Initially, manual handling of `touched` and `errors` states was present.  This was later refactored to leverage Formik's built-in capabilities, simplifying the code and improving readability.  The `hasError` helper function is used consistently for error styling. The final revision adds a `className` to the `Input` component for error styling.  A styling change to use "has-error" class instead of inline styling for error indication occurred.


`form.css`: This file contains styling rules for various form elements, including input fields, select elements, checkboxes, and date range pickers. There is a background image set for `.main__registration` and `.notfound` classes. A notable change is the refactoring of the error styling in `.form__control`.  Initially,  inline styling was used to apply red borders to error input fields; this was later changed to a class-based approach using the `has-error` class which simplifies maintenance.
