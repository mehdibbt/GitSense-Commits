# Activity Summary for 9/9/2025

## 1:02:39 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `CartPage.jsx` on September 9th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent:  fetching and displaying flight details from a cart, calculating prices based on company rules retrieved from Supabase, and handling passenger information.

The most significant changes are:

* **12:28:27 PM:** Initial commit.  The code is largely functional but includes commented-out sections for cart emptiness and expiry handling.  The passenger information section uses nested loops that are later refactored.  Import of `dayjs` is present but not fully utilized in date handling. There's also an issue in `clculateFlightTotal` where there's a missing `+` operator in the `flightPrice` calculation.

* **12:29:49 PM & 12:30:51 PM & 12:31:01 PM:** Minor revisions, primarily focusing on error handling and code cleanup. There are no significant functional differences between these commits. The `travelDate` variable's initialization is improved to handle potential null values.


* **12:32:32 PM:** A substantial change is introduced. The `return` statement is added showing the basic UI structure with the cart items count. This implies a shift toward rendering a basic view of the cart.  The commented-out sections related to empty cart and expiry are still present.

* **12:33:15 PM:** The `dayjs` import is removed, indicating a potential move away from using it for date manipulation.

* **12:50:17 PM & 12:51:18 PM:** Further refinements, primarily focusing on date handling using `dayjs`. The `travelDate` calculation is improved to handle potential null values, and comments suggest the introduction of DOB restrictions based on the travel date.


Throughout the revisions, the code consistently uses Supabase for data fetching (`companies` table, `price_rules` column), React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`), and Formik for form handling.  There's a focus on efficient rendering by selecting only necessary data from Redux.  The passenger information section undergoes refactoring, moving from nested loops to `Array.from` for more concise code.  The primary focus of changes revolves around refining error handling, improving date handling, and structuring the UI.


## 2:02:39 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `AppRoutes.jsx` between 1:10 PM and 1:11 PM on September 9, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor refactoring and code cleanup, with no significant functional changes to the routing configuration. The imports and the structure of the route definitions remain consistent across all revisions.  The commented-out code related to `generateComponentMap` also remains unchanged.

A separate change occurred at 1:14:39 PM to `passwordSet.jsx`, introducing a new component for password setting.  This component utilizes Formik for form management, interacts with Supabase for password updates and user information retrieval, and employs cookies for user session management after a successful password set.  The component includes error handling and visual feedback to the user.

Finally, there are multiple revisions to `CartPage.jsx` between 1:48 PM and 1:55 PM.  These revisions primarily focus on fetching and displaying flight data, calculating prices based on company price rules retrieved from the Supabase database, and handling passenger information.  The changes involve refining data fetching, price calculation logic within `clculateFlightTotal` and  `calculateFlightBreakdown`, and updating the component's use of Redux for managing cart data via the `loadCartFromSession` action. The `cartSlice` file path changed from `../../../features/Cart/CartSlice` to `../../../features/Cart/cartSlice` in the final revision.  The core functionality of handling passenger details with Formik and Yup remains the same, but  the code is reorganized and clarified.
