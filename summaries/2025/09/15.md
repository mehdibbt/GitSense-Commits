# Activity Summary for 9/15/2025

## 1:49:25 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `FlightContent.jsx` and `CartPage.jsx`, with a supporting role played by `FlightPassengerInfo.jsx`.  All changes occurred on September 15th, 2025.

`FlightContent.jsx` underwent two revisions within a minute of each other (12:54:03 PM and 12:55:01 PM).  The changes seem to be minor and do not affect the overall functionality of the component. The code represents a React component for flight search functionality, using various libraries like `@headlessui/react`, `@mui/material`, `react-icons`, and `antd`.  It handles user input for flight details (dates, airports, passengers, cabin class) and submits this data to a backend (likely using Redux).  The `submitForm` function formats the data and saves it to `sessionStorage` before navigating to the `/admin/flight-search` route.

`CartPage.jsx` was modified multiple times between 1:02:31 PM and 1:32:59 PM. This component displays a shopping cart for flight bookings.  It fetches company pricing rules from Supabase and calculates the total price, incorporating commission structures.  Significant changes include:

*   **1:23:19 PM**: A condition in `buildInitialPassengers` was corrected to ensure the function doesn't return an empty array when `events?.Flight?.length` is 0.  Previously there was a logical error that resulted in a potential crash when this component would get an empty array causing issues.
*   **1:24:29 PM**:  The `formik` form was modified by adding `initialValues` to properly initialize it. The form now correctly handles passenger information, dynamically creating fields based on the number of adults, children, and infants.
*   **1:25:27 PM**: The `initialValues` for the Formik form is now properly assigned by `initialValues`.

*   **1:32:59 PM**:  The `useFormik` hook was updated to include `enableReinitialize: true`, likely to ensure that the form re-renders and updates with new data.

`FlightPassengerInfo.jsx` (1:37:00 PM) shows a removed `FieldArray` component which suggests that the passenger information handling has been moved or modified in a different part of the application, which seems to be `CartPage.jsx`.

The recurring pattern across the changes involves the use of Supabase for data fetching, Formik for form handling, Ant Design components for UI elements, and Redux for state management.  The code is well-commented and follows a consistent style.  There is a consistent use of `dayjs` for date manipulation throughout the code base.
