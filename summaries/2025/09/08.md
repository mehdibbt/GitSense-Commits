# Activity Summary for 9/8/2025

## 12:33:15 PM
The `CartPage.jsx` component underwent several revisions on September 8th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was enhancing the passenger information input section within the cart.

Initially, the code lacked proper form handling and validation.  Around 11:55 AM, the component was updated to include a passenger input section generated dynamically based on the number of adults, children, and infants in a flight booking.  Each passenger input field included title, first name, last name, country, date of birth, passport country, passport number, and passport expiry.  Subsequent commits between 11:56 AM and 11:57 AM involved minor adjustments to the layout and styling of these input fields using Tailwind CSS classes, primarily focusing on the width and arrangement of elements in different screen sizes.  Specifically, the width of certain input fields (`Input` and `Select` components from `antd`) was adjusted for better responsiveness on medium and larger screens.

A significant change occurred at approximately 12:21 PM with the introduction of Formik for form management.  This replaced the previously rudimentary form submission and integrated validation using Yup.  Initially, only a `name` and `phone` field were presented within a Formik form; however, by 12:23 PM this was corrected to include `name` and `email` fields instead.  A further refinement at 12:26 PM involved connecting the Formik `handleSubmit`, `handleChange`, and `values` props to the input fields in order to correctly manage form state and handle submission.

Finally, at 12:32 PM,  a validation schema (`SignupSchema`) using Yup was implemented.  This improved form validation. The earlier attempts at validation (using `validationSchema` which acted on the passenger array) were seemingly replaced with this more structured and streamlined form approach, suggesting a shift towards a more modular and robust form handling mechanism.  Throughout the entire process, the code consistently interacts with Supabase to fetch company data (price rules) and country options.  The `useEffect` hooks manage data fetching and updates, ensuring the component remains synchronized with the backend.
