# Activity Summary for 9/24/2025

## 1:20:22 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `FlightContent.jsx` throughout the day on September 24th, 2025,  primarily focused on refining the UI component and potentially addressing bugs.  The changes are incremental, with minor adjustments made in quick succession.

The `FlightContent.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 12:33 PM and 1:13 PM.  Importantly, the Ant Design `Select` component was added around 12:45 PM, suggesting a UI update related to selecting options within the flight search form.  Prior to this, the `@headlessui/react` library's `Select` component was used. Around the same time (12:45 PM -12:46 PM),  the `@headlessui/react` library's `Select` component was removed. This indicates a shift in the UI framework used for select elements.

The CSS files (`form.css` and `Search.css`) also received updates later in the log. These updates added styling for various form elements, including Ant Design components and custom elements, and seem to be related to the overall styling of the flight search UI. There is a significant amount of Tailwind CSS utility classes used in both CSS files. The `form.css` update at 1:03:55 PM added styling specifically for child age selectors, indicating the addition or refinement of child age input functionality.  The `Search.css` file had style changes related to search tabs, dropdowns, and flight search result presentation (between 1:05 PM and 1:13 PM).  These changes are consistent with improving the visual presentation of the flight search functionality.

The core logic within `FlightContent.jsx` remained largely unchanged throughout these commits, suggesting the focus was primarily on front-end enhancements rather than backend alterations.  The use of `sessionStorage` to store flight search data persists.
