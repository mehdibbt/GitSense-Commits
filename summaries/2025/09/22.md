# Activity Summary for 9/22/2025

## 1:17:59 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a React application, likely a CRM system focusing on flight bookings.  Significant changes occurred between 12:21 PM and 12:58 PM on September 22, 2025.

**h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\supabase\functions\openai\index.ts:** This file implements a serverless function (likely using Supabase Functions and Deno) that interacts with the OpenAI API.  The function accepts a prompt, verifies authentication (using a Bearer token), forwards the prompt to OpenAI, and returns the AI's response. A hardcoded OpenAI API key is present in the code; this should be replaced with an environment variable for security.

**h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Search\FlightPassengerInfo.jsx:** This component handles the input of passenger information for flight bookings. Multiple updates to this file between 12:27 PM and 12:29 PM suggest iterative refinement. The code utilizes Ant Design components (`DatePicker`, `Select`, `Input`) for a user-friendly interface and Formik for form management.  Validation logic ensures that dates of birth and passport expiry dates are within reasonable ranges relative to the travel date.  The code is primarily focused on handling input and validation for adult passengers.

**h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\UI\ComboSearchInput\ComboSearchInput.jsx:** This reusable component provides a combobox for searching airports or airlines.  The most significant changes happen between 12:47 PM and 12:58 PM. Initially, the component had inefficient search logic. It was refactored to include debouncing (delaying API calls until typing pauses) and abort controllers (canceling in-flight requests when a new search begins).  A caching mechanism is added to store and reuse results, further improving performance. The component fetches data via POST requests to an API endpoint (`/searchAirports`) and uses `react-redux` for state management with airline searches.  The use of `@headlessui/react` for the Combobox suggests a focus on accessibility and a headless UI approach.  Importantly, the API URL is still using an environment variable, although a better approach would be to pass the base URL as a prop or configure it differently.


**h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightContent\FlightContent.jsx:** This component manages the flight search form. The single update at 1:13 PM shows the component uses various UI libraries (`@headlessui/react`, `@mui/material`, `antd`), along with React Router for navigation and Redux for state management. It handles user input for various search criteria (journey type, dates, airports, passenger numbers, cabin class, airline) and dispatches Redux actions to update the application state. The code also involves the storage of search data in `sessionStorage`.

In summary, the codebase is undergoing active development, with a focus on improving UI components, implementing efficient search logic, and integrating with external APIs (OpenAI and a travel-related API).  There's also a clear effort to manage state using Redux. The repeated commenting out of code sections in `FlightPassengerInfo.jsx` and `ComboSearchInput.jsx` suggests an experimental or iterative development process. The hardcoded API key in `index.ts` represents a security vulnerability that requires immediate attention.
