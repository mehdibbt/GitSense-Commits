# Activity Summary for 12/22/2025

## 2:13:19 PM
The changes log primarily details the evolution of components within the `BookingDetails` interface of a Supabase CRM application, specifically focusing on passenger and air segment information display and related actions.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingDetails\parts\Passengers.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 12/22/2025, 12:29:00 PM - 12/22/2025, 1:42:26 PM
    *   **Initial Setup (12:29 PM):** The `Passengers` component was initially created to display passenger details using a `DataTableList`, defining columns for name, DOB, passport information, and an eTicket number.
    *   **Action Column Evolution (12:37 PM - 1:00 PM):** An "Action" column was progressively added. Initially empty, it evolved to conditionally display "Invoiced" based on `folderInvoiceStatus.is_invoice`. Further iterations introduced checks for `flightStatus !== 'TICKETED'` or `folderInvoiceStatus?.folder_uid`, displaying `'-'` if those conditions were met. Otherwise, it provided options to add/edit eTicket numbers and download a PDF.
    *   **Prop and State Refactoring (12:44 PM - 1:42 PM):** The component's props were updated to accept `allData` (a more comprehensive data object) instead of just `passengers`. Internal state variables (`eticketEditModalOpen`, `editedPassId`, `selectedPassenger`) were introduced using `useState` to manage the UI for an eTicket editing modal. The `useMemo` hook was consistently used for `tableColumn` definitions.
    *   **Icon and Modal Integration (1:02 PM - 1:42 PM):** Custom icons from `react-icons/fa6` (`FaRegSquarePlus` for adding, `FaPenToSquare` for editing) were integrated into the "Action" column. A `ModalCustom` component was introduced for adding/editing eTicket numbers, binding its visibility and input values to the newly introduced state.
    *   **Conditional Logic Refinement (1:14 PM - 1:23 PM):** The action column's rendering logic was meticulously refined to prioritize display based on `folderInvoiceStatus.is_invoice`, then `flightStatus`, then `folderInvoiceStatus.folder_uid`, before offering interactive add/edit buttons.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingDetails\BookingDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 12/22/2025, 12:44:11 PM - 12/22/2025, 1:44:47 PM
    *   **Initial Complexity (12:44 PM):** This component is the orchestrator, managing a wide array of state variables related to booking details, user info, folder status, service cases (re-issue, refund), and tab navigation. It handles data fetching from Supabase and an external API (`axiosTseInstance`).
    *   **Modularization (1:08 PM, 1:44 PM):** Key updates involved importing and thus delegating specific UI and logic to newly created sub-components: `BookingDetailsButtons` and `AirSegments`. This suggests a strategic move to break down the large component into more manageable, focused units.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingDetails\parts\BookingDetailsButtons.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 12/22/2025, 1:12:12 PM
    *   **Component Creation:** This file was created to house the interactive buttons related to a booking.
    *   **`AddToFolder` Logic:** It includes an asynchronous `AddToFolder` function to persist booking data, including passenger information, into a 'folders' table in Supabase. It intelligently checks for existing folders and populates key details.
    *   **Dynamic Button Rendering:** It conditionally renders an "Add Folder" button or a suite of other action buttons (e.g., eTicket, Re-issue, Refund, TKT Issue, Status, PNR) based on the presence of folder data, booking status (`booking.status`), and user roles/permissions.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingDetails\parts\AirSegments.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 12/22/2025, 1:43:29 PM - 12/22/2025, 2:03:03 PM
    *   **Early Development (1:43 PM - 1:44 PM):** Initially, this component was a static HTML table for `contactDetails`. It was quickly refactored to accept `allData` and `folderInvoiceStatus` as props and render a simple placeholder.
    *   **DataTable Integration (1:48 PM):** It was then updated to use the `DataTableList` component to display flight air segments. The `useMemo` hook defined columns for flight details like origin, destination, dates, times, flight numbers, class, operating carrier, and baggage.
    *   **Date/Time Formatting Attempts (1:53 PM - 2:03 PM):** A series of rapid changes focused on correctly formatting departure and arrival dates/times. This included introducing `dayjs` for formatting and a `formatTimeHHMM` helper function. There were some temporary inconsistencies where time formatting was applied to a 'Dep Date' column.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Component Architecture:** A clear pattern of breaking down complex UI and logic into smaller, reusable React components (e.g., `BookingDetails` delegating to `Passengers`, `BookingDetailsButtons`, `AirSegments`).
*   **`useMemo` for Performance:** The `useMemo` hook is consistently used in both `Passengers.jsx` and `AirSegments.jsx` to memoize the `tableColumn` definitions, indicating an attention to rendering performance.
*   **Standardized Table Display:** Both `Passengers.jsx` and `AirSegments.jsx` leverage a `DataTableList` component, suggesting a consistent UI/UX for displaying tabular data throughout the application.
*   **Date and Time Formatting with `dayjs`:** The `dayjs` library is extensively used across multiple components for parsing and formatting date and time strings into user-friendly formats (e.g., 'DD/MM/YYYY', 'HHmm').
*   **Conditional Rendering:** User interface elements, particularly action buttons and status indicators, are frequently rendered conditionally based on various data states like `folderInvoiceStatus`, `flightStatus`, and `ticket_number`.
*   **Debugging via `console.log`:** Numerous `console.log` statements are present throughout the code, indicating active debugging during development stages.
*   **Future/Incomplete Features:** References to functions like `openTicketModal` and variables like `encodedBasketId` that are declared but not fully defined within the provided snippets, along with commented-out code blocks, suggest ongoing development and planned functionalities.

## 2:20:33 PM
The code changes primarily involve two Blade templates located within the `travnet-crm-v2` project, specifically for a backend EnquiryViewer interface related to flight bookings.

**File: `h:\wamp64\www\travnet-crm-v2\resources\views\backend\pages\EnquiryViewer\flights\bookingPartials\Passenger\passengers.blade.php`**
*   **Timestamp of initial change:** 12/22/2025, 12:23:34 PM (empty content, likely creation or clear).
*   **Timestamp of significant update:** 12/22/2025, 12:24:31 PM.
*   **Key Updates:** This file was updated to define a "Passenger" tab (`id="passenger"`) within an EnquiryViewer for flight bookings.
    *   It displays a responsive table listing flight passengers with details such as title, first name, last name, date of birth, gender, type, passport number, expiry date, country, and eTicket number.
    *   Crucially, alongside displaying the data, it includes hidden input fields (`<input type="hidden" name="prows[...]">`) for almost every passenger detail, likely for form submission or client-side processing.
    *   Conditional logic is present to handle passenger titles (e.g., 'Master' mapped to 'Mr') and to display actions based on the booking status and invoice status.
    *   If the booking status is 'TICKETED', users can add/edit eTicket numbers via a modal (`ticketadd-{{ $pass->flight_passenger_id }}`) and download a flight itinerary PDF.
    *   A comprehensive "Compose Email" modal (`modal_ticket_mail`) is included, pre-populating an email with dynamic company information (`$company_all_info`), booking specifics, payment details, and contact information. The email subject defaults to "Airticket with Ticket no [ticket_number]".
    *   There's an incomplete `elseif` block indicating potential future or existing functionality for displaying hotel passenger details, although the provided code snippet only shows the table header.

**File: `h:\wamp64\www\travnet-crm-v2\resources\views\backend\pages\EnquiryViewer\flights\bookingPartials\ItineraryItem\partials\airsegments.blade.php`**
*   **Timestamp of update:** 12/22/2025, 1:51:07 PM.
*   **Key Updates:** This file was updated to define an "Airsegment" tab (`id="airsegment"`) for displaying flight itinerary details.
    *   It presents a table summarizing each air segment of a flight, including origin, departure date and time, destination, arrival date and time, flight number, cabin class, whether it's an inbound or outbound segment, the operating carrier, and baggage allowance.
    *   Dates are formatted to `d/m/Y`, and times are formatted to `H:i` then have the colon removed (e.g., "14:30" becomes "1430").
    *   Many fields use the null coalescing operator (`?? '-'`) to display a hyphen if the data is unavailable.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Blade Templating:** Both files are Laravel Blade templates (`.blade.php`), utilizing Blade directives like `@if`, `@foreach`, and `{{ $variable }}` for dynamic content rendering.
*   **Table-based Data Display:** Both templates primarily use HTML `<table>` elements to present structured data in a clear, tabular format.
*   **Contextual Data:** The templates are designed to display data (`$flightPassengers`, `$flightAirsegments`, `$booking`, `$company_all_info`) passed from a controller, indicating a server-side rendering approach.
*   **Hidden Inputs for Data Persistence:** The `passengers.blade.php` file extensively uses hidden input fields to store displayed data, suggesting this data might be used in subsequent form submissions or client-side operations without being visible to the user.
*   **Date/Time Formatting:** A consistent pattern of formatting dates to `d/m/Y` is observed across both files.
*   **Modals for Interaction:** The `passengers.blade.php` file implements modals for specific user interactions (adding eTicket numbers, sending emails).
*   **`?? '-'` for Missing Data:** Both files frequently use the null coalescing operator (`?? '-'`) to display a hyphen when a data field is empty or null, ensuring a consistent user experience for missing information.
*   **File Path Structure:** The consistent file path `h:\wamp64\www\travnet-crm-v2\resources\views\backend\pages\EnquiryViewer\flights\bookingPartials\...` indicates a modular structure for displaying different parts of a flight booking within a CRM's enquiry viewer.
