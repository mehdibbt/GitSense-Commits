# Activity Summary for 12/28/2025

## 2:28:05 PM
The `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingDetails\parts\BookingDetailsButtons.jsx` file underwent several iterations of changes throughout the day, primarily focused on the `AddToFolder` asynchronous function, which is responsible for creating a new "folder" entry in a CRM system and populating it with booking details from an external booking.

**File: `BookingDetailsButtons.jsx`**

*   **12/28/2025, 12:13:41 PM**: The initial state of the `AddToFolder` function was to check if a booking already exists in a folder. It included preparatory logic for extracting booking data (contact details, flights, hotels, transfers, passengers, price, air segments) and defining how different booking services map to CRM folder options. Crucially, the core logic for *creating* the folder, inserting passengers, and air segments, and generating tickets was heavily commented out.
*   **12/28/2025, 12:42:01 PM - 1:31:52 PM**: Multiple saves occurred during this period without any discernible functional code changes. The large block of commented-out logic remained untouched.
*   **12/28/2025, 1:39:11 PM**: This was a significant update. The previously commented-out block of code within the `if (folderData.length === 0)` condition was uncommented, activating the logic for:
    *   Creating a new folder record in the `folders` Supabase table with details like `folder_uid`, `created_by`, `company_id`, `booking_reference`, and travel options.
    *   Inserting passenger data (title, first name, last name, DOB, passport details, etc.) into the `passengers` table.
    *   Inserting air segment details (airline, flight number, departure/arrival cities, status) into the `airsegments` table.
    *   A new comprehensive section for generating and inserting "air tickets" was introduced. This involved complex pricing calculations (`buildPricePoolByType`, `buildPassengerPricing`) to determine buy, sell, and commission totals per passenger, and then inserting these structured ticket objects into the `airtickets` table.
*   **12/28/2025, 1:39:55 PM**: A refinement was made to ensure consistency. The `passengerData` variable, intended to hold the IDs of newly created passengers, was correctly assigned the result from the `passengers` table insertion. The `allTickets` mapping was updated to use this `passengerData` and reference `pax.id` for `passenger_id`, aligning ticket creation with the newly inserted passenger records.
*   **12/28/2025, 1:42:01 PM**: The target Supabase table for tickets was renamed from `airtickets` to `air_tickets`. Additionally, a `created_at` timestamp was added to the ticket object being inserted.
*   **12/28/2025, 1:44:18 PM**: The `uid` function call for `ticket_uid` was simplified, removing the explicit `len: 8` option.
*   **12/28/2025, 1:57:36 PM**: Several new fields (`vendor_name`, `vendor_id`, `airline_code`, `ticketing_bsp`, `is_client_card`, `ticketing_conf_no`, `ticketing_atol`, `ticket_atol_tkt_issue`, `ticketing_cabin`) were added to the `allTickets` object during insertion, indicating an expansion of the air ticket schema.
*   **12/28/2025, 2:03:51 PM**: No functional changes were observed.
*   **12/28/2025, 2:08:25 PM**: The `buildPassengerPricing` and `allTickets` mapping functions were updated to explicitly use the `passengerData` (which contains the newly inserted passenger records) instead of the original `passengers` array from `flights[0]`. This ensures that ticket pricing is correctly linked to the persisted passenger data.
*   **12/28/2025, 2:08:34 PM**: A critical correction was made in the `allTickets` mapping: `passenger_id` was changed from `pax.flight_passenger_id` to `pax.id`, reflecting that the `passengerData` now contains the Supabase-generated IDs for passengers. The `paxTypeMap` lookup was also updated to use `pax.pax_type.toLowerCase()`.
*   **12/28/2025, 2:11:30 PM - 2:14:31 PM**: No functional changes were observed.
*   **12/28/2025, 2:14:56 PM**: A new import `paxType` was added from `../../../../../constants/Settings/Folder`, and a debugging `console.log("Pricing for passenger", pax);` statement was inserted.

**File: `AirTicket.jsx`**

*   **12/28/2025, 1:53:17 PM**: This file, responsible for managing Air Tickets within a folder in the backend interface, was introduced or significantly updated. It imports numerous components and hooks, sets up state for managing ticket data, modals (add, edit, delete, email), and loading states.
    *   It defines `fetchAirTicketData` to retrieve air tickets (both normal and re-issued) from the `air_tickets` table, including joining with `passengers` and `vendors`.
    *   `loadPassAndNotes` fetches notes for the invoice.
    *   Formik instances (`AirTicketAdd`, `AirTicketUpdate`) are used for form handling, validation, and submitting data to Supabase for insertion and updates into the `air_tickets` table.
    *   It includes logic to prefill PNRs and handle soft deletion of tickets.
    *   An `ActionColumnTemplate` is defined for the data table, providing actions like edit, delete, email, and PDF download (using `AirTicketPDF`).

**File: `AirTicketModalBody.jsx`**

*   **12/28/2025, 2:20:48 PM**: This component defines the UI and logic for adding or editing an air ticket within a modal.
    *   It manages local state for `totals` related to ticketing (buy, sell, payable, commission, VATs) and `selectedPassengers` for associating a ticket with a passenger.
    *   A `passengerTableColumn` is defined to display a list of passengers, allowing the user to select one via a radio button.
    *   A critical feature is the dynamic pricing table, managed by `initializePrices`, `getRowCount`, `addPriceRow`, and `removePriceRow`.
    *   `updatePriceField` includes auto-calculation logic: when buy, VATs, or commission fields change, the `sell` price is automatically updated, and when sell or sell-related VATs change, the `payable` amount is updated.
    *   `calculateTotals` aggregates all row-level pricing into overall totals.
*   **12/28/2025, 2:21:11 PM - 2:24:32 PM**: Multiple saves occurred with no functional changes.
*   **12/28/2025, 2:25:08 PM**: A debugging `console.log("Calculating totals...", currentPrices);` was added inside `calculateTotals`.
*   **12/28/2025, 2:26:35 PM**: A minor safety change to `currentPrices.buy?.length` was made in `calculateTotals`.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Supabase Interaction**: All files extensively use Supabase for database operations (insert, select, update) across multiple tables (`folders`, `passengers`, `airsegments`, `air_tickets`).
*   **Data Consistency**: There is a clear effort to ensure data consistency, particularly between newly created passenger records and the tickets linked to them. The repeated adjustments to `passengerData` and `pax.id` in `BookingDetailsButtons.jsx` highlight this.
*   **Complex Pricing Logic**: Both `BookingDetailsButtons.jsx` (for automated ticket generation) and `AirTicketModalBody.jsx` (for manual input) handle detailed pricing structures including buy, sell, commission, and various VAT components, along with auto-calculation. This structure often involves arrays for each price component to support multiple line items.
*   **Date Handling**: `dayjs` is consistently used for parsing and formatting dates across different parts of the application.
*   **Unique Identifiers**: The `uid` utility is used for generating unique IDs for folders and tickets, indicating a common pattern for generating primary keys or unique references.
*   **Component-based UI**: The application follows a component-based architecture, with specialized components like `BookingDetailsButtons`, `AirTicket`, and `AirTicketModalBody` handling specific parts of the UI and business logic.
*   **Active Development/Debugging**: The presence of numerous `console.log` statements and frequent saves with minor or no functional changes suggest an active development phase, likely involving debugging and iterative refinement of the new "Add to Folder" and "Air Ticket" features.
*   **Modular Utility Functions**: Imports like `utilityFunction`, `SupabaseClient`, and constants from `Settings/Folder` show a structured approach to common functionalities.
