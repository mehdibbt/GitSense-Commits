# Activity Summary for 5/26/2025

## 12:58:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `flightsSlice.js` file and its associated components (`FareRules.jsx` and `FlightSearch.jsx`) between 12:17 PM and 12:37 PM on May 26, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes centers around fetching and displaying flight data, including fare rules.

**flightsSlice.js:**  This file underwent several updates.  Notably, the `fetchFareRules` asynchronous thunk was significantly altered, changing its input parameter from a `fareRuleObj` to an `index`, enabling retrieval of fare rules based on the selected flight's index in the Redux store.  Minor formatting adjustments are also visible across multiple commits.  The logic for handling different suppliers (TBO and HitchHiker) in fare rule fetching was refined.  The initial `initialState` included placeholders for `minPrice`, `maxPrice` (set to 2000), and `currency`.


**FareRules.jsx:** This component, responsible for displaying fare rules, evolved to incorporate a modal for improved user experience.  The initial version lacked error handling and loading indicators.  Subsequent changes integrated a `SearchLoader` component for visual feedback during asynchronous operations and added a `ModalCustom` component to present the fare rules in a modal dialog.  The modal now dynamically adjusts its size based on the supplier ("HitchHiker" uses a larger modal than others). The component correctly imports `SearchLoader` and `ModalCustom` only in later commits.

**FlightSearch.jsx:** This component, displaying the flight search results, shows consistent additions of features and refinements.  The main change was the integration of the updated `FareRules` component, enhancing the flight display with fare rule access.  The `selectFlightHandeller` function now uses `navigate` to redirect to '/admin/cart' upon successful flight selection.  A loading indicator was also added using the `SearchLoader` component.  The `getInitialAvailStrings` helper function was added to extract availStrings from the flight data.  The UI was modified to include "Refundable" and "Non-Refundable" indicators based on the `isRefundable` property of flight objects.  The commented-out code suggests earlier attempts at different approaches to handling fare rules and selection.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate an iterative development process, adding features, improving error handling, and refining the UI for a better user experience in displaying flight search results and associated fare rules. The most significant change was the refactoring of `fetchFareRules` and the integration of the modal within `FareRules.jsx`.
