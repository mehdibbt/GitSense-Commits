# Activity Summary for 5/27/2025

## 1:23:58 PM
The log shows multiple updates to components related to flight search functionality within a React application.  The `FlightSearch.jsx` component underwent two near-identical updates between 12:45 PM and 12:47 PM, with minimal changes.  These updates primarily involve UI refinements and minor code restructuring, not affecting the core functionality.

The `AirSegments.jsx` component was updated three times between 12:48 PM and 12:49 PM.  These changes focused on refining how fare rules are updated in the Redux store. Initially, the `setFareRules` action only included the `index`, which was then corrected to include `singleFlight?.id`, ensuring proper identification of fare rules for each flight. A final update at 12:49:22 PM slightly adjusted the payload structure in `setFareRules` from `{singleFlight?.id, fareRules:updated}` to `{id: singleFlight?.id, fareRules:updated}`, likely for improved clarity or consistency.

The `flightsSlice.js` file shows the most significant changes, undergoing five revisions between 12:50 PM and 1:06 PM.  These revisions center around improving the `setFareRules` reducer.  Early versions had issues correctly updating the `fareRules` array within the Redux store. The final version (1:06:02 PM) addresses this by finding the specific rule using `find` before updating it, preventing unintended overwrites.  This suggests an evolving understanding and handling of fare rule data within the application's state management.  The `flightsSlice` also contains asynchronous thunks for fetching flight data, airlines, and airports from different APIs (potentially TSE and a separate `/api/airport-detail-info` endpoint), suggesting a complex data fetching and processing pipeline within the application.  The use of `import.meta.env.VITE_REACT_APP_TSE_URL` indicates environment variables are used for API endpoints.
