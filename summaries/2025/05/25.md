# Activity Summary for 5/25/2025

## 12:00:33 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `flightsSlice.js` and `AirSegments.jsx`, between 11:15 AM and 11:55 AM on May 25, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on flight data handling and UI updates.

**flightsSlice.js:** This file, a Redux slice, underwent numerous revisions, mostly concerning the `setFareRules` reducer. Initial versions had commented-out code related to fare rules fetching, suggesting an iterative development process. Later versions introduced and refined the `setFareRules` reducer to handle fare rule updates, initially with an `index` and `array` parameter and then refined to take `index` and `fareRules` parameters for better clarity and potentially improved data structure.  The `extraReducers` section consistently manages loading and error states for various asynchronous thunks (`fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, `fetchAirlines`, `fetchFlighstData`), indicating a robust error-handling strategy.  No significant changes occurred to the other reducers or async thunks.

**AirSegments.jsx:** This React component renders flight segments.  The key change involves how selected flights are handled and dispatched to the Redux store via `setSelectedFlight` and `setFareRules`. Early versions attempted to pass both the index and selected flights, but this was ultimately simplified to only dispatch the updated `selectedFlights` array. The final version directly dispatches the updated array through `setFareRules` to synchronize the selected flight segments with the fare rules in the Redux store.  Minor stylistic and structural changes also occurred, but the core functionality of flight segment selection and rendering remained unchanged.  The use of `memo` suggests optimization attempts to improve component re-rendering performance.


The overall pattern across changes reflects a focus on improving the management of fare rules within the application state and the UI components' interaction with that state.  The frequent updates to `flightsSlice.js` and `AirSegments.jsx` during this period suggest focused development on integrating flight selection with fare rule retrieval and display.


## 1:00:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `flightsSlice.js` and `FlightPrice.jsx`.  Both files are related to flight data fetching and display within a React application, likely a client-side CRM for travel.


**flightsSlice.js:** This Redux slice manages flight data.  The most significant changes revolve around the `fetchFareRules` asynchronous thunk. Initially, this thunk was incomplete or commented out.  Subsequent revisions progressively implemented it, handling fare rules retrieval based on the flight supplier (TBO and HitchHiker).  A key modification at  12:20:30 PM introduced supplier-specific handling of the fare rules response, particularly to accommodate the structure of data from the HitchHiker supplier. Further refinement at 12:33:05 PM and 12:34:49 PM focused on ensuring correct data handling for TBO and HitchHiker suppliers in `fetchFareRules`, adding more specific return values depending on the supplier. At 12:39:49 PM and 12:40:58 PM, minor refinements were made in the same function. The file also includes other async thunks (`fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, `fetchAirlines`) for fetching flight fares, airport details, and airline names from different API endpoints.  The use of `axios` for API calls and `redux-toolkit` for creating slices and async thunks is consistent throughout.


**FlightPrice.jsx:** This component is responsible for displaying flight prices and providing a "Fare Rules" feature.  The initial revision at 12:01:04 PM contained a basic price display with a dropdown for more details.  A subsequent revision at 12:01:22 PM made the modal displaying fare rules functional, while the version at 12:01:31 PM  reverting the change made in the previous revision. Then at 12:02:13 PM, a parameter was removed from the `fareRulesController` function. The modifications between 12:36:22 PM and 12:59:06 PM focused on enhancing the modal which shows the fare rules. This involved integrating Ant Design's `Tabs` component to display fare rules in a more structured manner, especially for the HitchHiker supplier, where the fare rules appear to come in a structured format needing parsed and rendered within tabs. The last revision at 12:51:58 PM and 12:55:03 PM focused on the improvement of the UI/UX design which made the fare rules more readable and structured for the HitchHiker supplier, which is also reflected in the increased size of the modal to accommodate this change.  The changes involved a significant restructuring of the `modalBody` function to parse and display the rules in a tabbed format, improving the readability for the HitchHiker supplier's data. A change in the modal's size was also implemented to make sure the changes are reflected in the UI.


In summary, the code changes reflect a gradual implementation and refinement of the fare rules functionality.  The development process involved several iterations, focusing on correctly fetching and displaying fare rules according to different data structures received from various suppliers, and finally the design of the UI was improved in the end to reflect the changes.  The consistent use of `axios` and `redux-toolkit` indicates a consistent approach to data fetching and state management throughout the project.
