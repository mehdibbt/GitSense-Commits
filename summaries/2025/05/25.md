# Activity Summary for 5/25/2025

## 12:00:33 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `flightsSlice.js` and `AirSegments.jsx`, between 11:15 AM and 11:55 AM on May 25, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on flight data handling and UI updates.

**flightsSlice.js:** This file, a Redux slice, underwent numerous revisions, mostly concerning the `setFareRules` reducer. Initial versions had commented-out code related to fare rules fetching, suggesting an iterative development process. Later versions introduced and refined the `setFareRules` reducer to handle fare rule updates, initially with an `index` and `array` parameter and then refined to take `index` and `fareRules` parameters for better clarity and potentially improved data structure.  The `extraReducers` section consistently manages loading and error states for various asynchronous thunks (`fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, `fetchAirlines`, `fetchFlighstData`), indicating a robust error-handling strategy.  No significant changes occurred to the other reducers or async thunks.

**AirSegments.jsx:** This React component renders flight segments.  The key change involves how selected flights are handled and dispatched to the Redux store via `setSelectedFlight` and `setFareRules`. Early versions attempted to pass both the index and selected flights, but this was ultimately simplified to only dispatch the updated `selectedFlights` array. The final version directly dispatches the updated array through `setFareRules` to synchronize the selected flight segments with the fare rules in the Redux store.  Minor stylistic and structural changes also occurred, but the core functionality of flight segment selection and rendering remained unchanged.  The use of `memo` suggests optimization attempts to improve component re-rendering performance.


The overall pattern across changes reflects a focus on improving the management of fare rules within the application state and the UI components' interaction with that state.  The frequent updates to `flightsSlice.js` and `AirSegments.jsx` during this period suggest focused development on integrating flight selection with fare rule retrieval and display.


## 1:00:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `flightsSlice.js` and `FlightPrice.jsx`.  Both files are related to flight data fetching and display within a React application, likely a client-side CRM for travel.


**flightsSlice.js:** This Redux slice manages flight data.  The most significant changes revolve around the `fetchFareRules` asynchronous thunk. Initially, this thunk was incomplete or commented out.  Subsequent revisions progressively implemented it, handling fare rules retrieval based on the flight supplier (TBO and HitchHiker).  A key modification at  12:20:30 PM introduced supplier-specific handling of the fare rules response, particularly to accommodate the structure of data from the HitchHiker supplier. Further refinement at 12:33:05 PM and 12:34:49 PM focused on ensuring correct data handling for TBO and HitchHiker suppliers in `fetchFareRules`, adding more specific return values depending on the supplier. At 12:39:49 PM and 12:40:58 PM, minor refinements were made in the same function. The file also includes other async thunks (`fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, `fetchAirlines`) for fetching flight fares, airport details, and airline names from different API endpoints.  The use of `axios` for API calls and `redux-toolkit` for creating slices and async thunks is consistent throughout.


**FlightPrice.jsx:** This component is responsible for displaying flight prices and providing a "Fare Rules" feature.  The initial revision at 12:01:04 PM contained a basic price display with a dropdown for more details.  A subsequent revision at 12:01:22 PM made the modal displaying fare rules functional, while the version at 12:01:31 PM  reverting the change made in the previous revision. Then at 12:02:13 PM, a parameter was removed from the `fareRulesController` function. The modifications between 12:36:22 PM and 12:59:06 PM focused on enhancing the modal which shows the fare rules. This involved integrating Ant Design's `Tabs` component to display fare rules in a more structured manner, especially for the HitchHiker supplier, where the fare rules appear to come in a structured format needing parsed and rendered within tabs. The last revision at 12:51:58 PM and 12:55:03 PM focused on the improvement of the UI/UX design which made the fare rules more readable and structured for the HitchHiker supplier, which is also reflected in the increased size of the modal to accommodate this change.  The changes involved a significant restructuring of the `modalBody` function to parse and display the rules in a tabbed format, improving the readability for the HitchHiker supplier's data. A change in the modal's size was also implemented to make sure the changes are reflected in the UI.


In summary, the code changes reflect a gradual implementation and refinement of the fare rules functionality.  The development process involved several iterations, focusing on correctly fetching and displaying fare rules according to different data structures received from various suppliers, and finally the design of the UI was improved in the end to reflect the changes.  The consistent use of `axios` and `redux-toolkit` indicates a consistent approach to data fetching and state management throughout the project.


## 2:00:28 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\assets\modules\Search\Search.css` on May 25, 2025.  The file contains cascading style sheet (CSS) code, heavily using a `@apply` directive suggesting a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.

The changes between 1:02:42 PM and 1:03:36 PM appear to be minor, likely involving only whitespace or formatting adjustments as the code remains largely consistent across those timestamps.  The code is extensive, styling various elements related to a search interface including:

* **Search Tabs:** Styles for tabs (`search-tab-btn`, `Mui-selected`), their indicator, and containers.
* **Form Groups:** Styles for form labels, inputs (including calendar inputs), icons, and associated elements.  These styles are consistent in their use of utility classes and variables for colors (`text-primaryText`, `bg-inputBg`, `border-border2`, `text-primaryBlue`, etc.).
* **Dropdown:** Styles for a dropdown component (`dropdown-wrapper`), list items, and active/selected states.
* **Flight Search Results:** Styles for flight search result containers, individual flight segments, airline information, baggage information, duration display and more, indicating the styles are likely for a flight search feature within a larger application.

A significant change may have occurred between 1:03:36 PM and 1:46:53 PM, though the exact nature of the change is not readily apparent from a simple visual comparison of the code. The subsequent updates at 1:51:54 PM and 1:59:55 PM seem to be yet again minimal adjustments, based on the identical code among those timestamps.  There is a recurring pattern of using inline styles (`!important`) alongside the utility classes.  This might indicate a style conflict resolution process, or a transitional phase between the two approaches.  The overall pattern suggests iterative refinement of the styling for the search module.


## 3:00:33 PM
The log shows multiple updates to `Search.css` and `flightsSlice.js` on May 25, 2025.  `Search.css` underwent numerous minor revisions between 2:01 PM and 2:25 PM, primarily involving styling adjustments using a combination of inline styles and a `@apply` utility (likely from a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS).  These changes affected various elements, including buttons, forms, input fields, dropdowns, and flight search result containers.  The changes were incremental and didn't introduce major structural alterations; instead, they focused on refining visual aspects like colors, spacing, shadows, and border styles.


The `flightsSlice.js` file was updated several times between 2:42 PM and 2:56 PM.  These updates involved adding a new async thunk `selectFlight` to handle the selection of a flight, and modifications to the `fetchFareRules` thunk, simplifying its logic and handling different suppliers ("TBO" and "HitchHiker") differently.  The initial state includes properties for managing loading states, errors, flights data, airlines data, airport data, carrier codes, minimum and maximum prices, currency, and a timer.  Multiple asynchronous thunks (`fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, `fetchAirlines`, `fetchFlighstData`) are used to fetch data from different endpoints, likely for a flight search feature.  The `fetchFlighstData` thunk notably chains multiple API calls. The use of `createAsyncThunk` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` indicates a Redux architecture for state management.  The frequent updates suggest iterative development and debugging of the flight data fetching and handling logic within the Redux store.  The final version of `flightsSlice.js` includes the `selectFlight` action in the `flightsSlice.actions` export.  The `FlightSearch.jsx` component, updated at 2:54 PM and 2:58 PM, uses these Redux actions to manage the flight data, showing a loading indicator and then displaying paginated flight search results with details, pricing, and selection functionality.


## 4:00:41 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `FlightSearch.jsx` component and the `flightsSlice.js` Redux slice.  The changes primarily focus on flight search functionality, data fetching, and UI improvements.

**`h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightSearch.jsx`:**

This file underwent multiple revisions between 3:00 PM and 3:50 PM on May 25, 2025.  The key changes include:

* **3:00 PM - Initial Version:**  This version establishes the FlightSearch component, fetching flight data, handling pagination (flightsPerPage = 20), and rendering flight results.  It uses Redux for state management and `react-router-dom` for routing. The component fetches data from an API endpoint (`/getFares`).  It also fetches airline and airport data after the initial flight search.  The UI displays a loading spinner and includes `AirSegments`, `FlightPrice`, and `ModilfySearch` components.  A `selectFlightHandeller` function dispatches a Redux action (`selectFlight`)  but lacks error handling.

* **3:05 PM - Error Handling Added:**  A `try...catch` block was added to the `selectFlightHandeller` function to handle potential errors during flight selection.


* **3:07 PM - Error Handling Removed:** The `try...catch` block added in the previous revision was removed.

* **3:08 PM - Error Handling Re-added:** The `try...catch` block was re-added to the `selectFlightHandeller` function.


* **3:23 PM - No significant changes:** A minor formatting difference, potentially due to code reformatting.


* **3:26 PM - `useCallback` Hook:**  The `selectFlightHandeller` function was wrapped in `useCallback` to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.  The `<a>` tags within the `selectFlightHandeller` were changed to `<button>` tags


* **3:26 PM - Minor change:**  The  `FlightSearch` component was wrapped in `memo` to prevent re-renders when unnecessary.


* **3:31 PM - Button change:** `<a>` tags were changed to `<button>` tags in the component.

* **3:31 PM - No significant changes:** A minor formatting difference, potentially due to code reformatting.


* **3:40 PM - State Variable:** A state variable `selectingIndex` was introduced to manage the loading state for flight selection.


* **3:42 PM - Removed Try Catch:** removed try catch block from the  `selectFlightHandeller` function.


* **3:43 PM - Removed Try Catch again:** removed try catch block from the  `selectFlightHandeller` function.


* **3:45 PM - No significant changes:** A minor formatting difference, potentially due to code reformatting.


* **3:48 PM - No significant changes:** A minor formatting difference, potentially due to code reformatting.


* **3:50 PM - No significant changes:** A minor formatting difference, potentially due to code reformatting.



**`h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\features\Flight\flightsSlice.js`:**

This file was updated at 3:23 PM and 3:40 PM, and 3:50 PM and 3:58 PM on May 25, 2025. The significant changes are:

* **3:23 PM - Initial State and Async Thunks:**  The `flightsSlice` was created, defining the initial state for flight data, airlines, airports, loading states, and other parameters. Several `createAsyncThunk` actions were added for fetching flights (`fetchFlights`), airports (`fetchAirports`), and airlines (`fetchAirlines`), along with a combined thunk (`fetchFlighstData`).  The `selectFlight` thunk was created, but it only logged data. A `fetchFareRules` thunk was also created to fetch fare rules for selected flights.

* **3:40 PM - selectFlight Thunk Enhancement:** The `selectFlight` thunk was updated to include a  loading state in the slice, and added a try...catch block.

* **3:50 PM - selectFlight Thunk Enhancement:** The `selectFlight` thunk now makes an additional API call (`/revalidatePrices`) to revalidate prices after a flight is selected. The  `try...catch` block was removed again.  The loading state management in the reducer was removed.

* **3:58 PM - selectFlight Thunk Enhancement:** Correct API call and the `try...catch` block was re-added again.


**`h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\assets\modules\Search\Search.css`:**

This file received updates at 3:31 PM, 3:34 PM, and 3:36 PM on May 25, 2025.  These changes appear to be purely CSS styling adjustments for various elements within the search UI.  There are no functional changes reflected in the CSS updates.  The updates were likely to adjust appearance such as styling for buttons, forms, dropdown menus, and flight result display elements.


In summary, the primary development effort focused on the `FlightSearch` component and its interaction with the `flightsSlice`. The focus was on improving data fetching, handling pagination, enhancing the UI,  and implementing better error handling for flight selection, and adding an API call to revalidate the prices. The CSS changes were supplementary, aimed at refining the visual appearance of the flight search interface.


## 5:00:31 PM
The log shows significant updates to the flight search functionality within a React application, along with routing changes.

**`h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightSearch.jsx`**:  This component underwent multiple revisions on May 25th, 2025.  The initial version (4:02:40 PM)  displayed flight search results, using pagination and Redux to manage data fetching and loading states.  A custom loader was implemented. The most significant change occurred at 4:47:13 PM where `useNavigate` hook was added to redirect to `/admin/cart` after a flight is selected.  Before this, a custom loader was used, replaced later with `SearchLoader` for better UI feedback. The component interacts with Redux slices (`flightSearchSlice`, `flightsSlice`) for data management.

**`h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\features\Flight\flightsSlice.js`**: This Redux slice manages flight data. It was updated at 4:12:37 PM.  The update introduced multiple asynchronous thunks (`fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, `fetchAirlines`, `fetchFlighstData`, `selectFlight`, `fetchFareRules`) using `redux-toolkit` to handle API interactions for fetching flights, airports, airlines, and fare rules.  The `selectFlight` thunk now revalidates prices after selection.

**`h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\pages\backend\Search\CartPage.jsx`**:  This component was created and subsequently modified throughout the log. It represents a basic "CartPage" component. The final version (4:49:57 PM) simply renders "CartPage".

**`h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\routes\AppRoutes.jsx`**: The application's routing configuration was adjusted multiple times (between 4:20:10 PM and 4:52:50 PM).  A `/admin/cart` route was added to handle the cart functionality, which is linked to FlightSearch component's redirection.  There were multiple revisions with no apparent functional changes, suggesting potential cleanup or refactoring efforts.

**`h:\wamp64\www\travnet-v3\client-CRM\src\routes\AppRoutes2.jsx`**: This file, introduced at 4:42:24 PM, implements dynamic routing using React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting. This approach improves initial load times by loading components on demand. The dynamic routes are defined in `DynamicRoute` and added to the routes using `generateRoutes`.


The overall pattern reveals a focused effort on enhancing the flight search and booking flow.  The introduction of dynamic routing in `AppRoutes2.jsx` suggests an improvement in performance and maintainability.  The repeated revisions to `AppRoutes.jsx` without content changes could be related to merge conflicts or experimentation.
