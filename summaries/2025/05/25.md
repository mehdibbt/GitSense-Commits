# Activity Summary for 5/25/2025

## 12:00:33 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `flightsSlice.js` and `AirSegments.jsx`, between 11:15 AM and 11:55 AM on May 25, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on flight data handling and UI updates.

**flightsSlice.js:** This file, a Redux slice, underwent numerous revisions, mostly concerning the `setFareRules` reducer. Initial versions had commented-out code related to fare rules fetching, suggesting an iterative development process. Later versions introduced and refined the `setFareRules` reducer to handle fare rule updates, initially with an `index` and `array` parameter and then refined to take `index` and `fareRules` parameters for better clarity and potentially improved data structure.  The `extraReducers` section consistently manages loading and error states for various asynchronous thunks (`fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, `fetchAirlines`, `fetchFlighstData`), indicating a robust error-handling strategy.  No significant changes occurred to the other reducers or async thunks.

**AirSegments.jsx:** This React component renders flight segments.  The key change involves how selected flights are handled and dispatched to the Redux store via `setSelectedFlight` and `setFareRules`. Early versions attempted to pass both the index and selected flights, but this was ultimately simplified to only dispatch the updated `selectedFlights` array. The final version directly dispatches the updated array through `setFareRules` to synchronize the selected flight segments with the fare rules in the Redux store.  Minor stylistic and structural changes also occurred, but the core functionality of flight segment selection and rendering remained unchanged.  The use of `memo` suggests optimization attempts to improve component re-rendering performance.


The overall pattern across changes reflects a focus on improving the management of fare rules within the application state and the UI components' interaction with that state.  The frequent updates to `flightsSlice.js` and `AirSegments.jsx` during this period suggest focused development on integrating flight selection with fare rule retrieval and display.
