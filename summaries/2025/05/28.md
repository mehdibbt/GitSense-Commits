# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 1:11:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `flightsSlice.js` file and `FlightSearch.jsx` file within the `travnet-v3` project on May 28, 2025.  The `flightsSlice.js` file underwent several iterative changes, primarily focused on refining Redux logic for fetching and managing flight data, airline information, and fare rules.  These changes involved adjustments to asynchronous thunks (`fetchFlights`, `fetchAirports`, `fetchAirlines`, `fetchFlighstData`, `selectFlight`, `fetchFareRules`),  and reducers within the `flightsSlice`.  The most significant changes included updating the `selectFlight` thunk to  include  a call to `/revalidatePrices` endpoint at 12:49 PM, and fixing a bug in  `fetchFareRules` by changing the `find` method  at 12:43 PM.  The modifications show a consistent pattern of improving error handling (e.g., adding `rejectWithValue` to several thunks), and  streamlining the data flow between API calls and Redux state. The  `FlightSearch.jsx` component  was updated at 12:49 PM to incorporate the changes in the `flightsSlice` (specifically, the addition of the `revalidatePrices` API call).  A  `nonRefundable` option was added at the same time. The `AirSegments.jsx` file was updated at 12:37 PM; this update focused on improving the handling of flight segment selection and dispatching fare rules updates to the Redux store using the `setFareRules` action.  The `FareRules.jsx` component was modified twice (12:40 PM and 12:40 PM),  improving the display of fare rules from different suppliers ("TBO" and "HitchHiker") using Ant Design's `Tabs` component to present fare rules in a more organized manner within a modal.  The overall pattern indicates a development process focused on integrating flight data from multiple APIs, enhancing the user interface to display this data effectively, and improving the application's error handling and resilience.
