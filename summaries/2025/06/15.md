# Activity Summary for 6/15/2025

## 2:57:16 PM
The log shows the evolution of a TypeScript program managing pizza orders.  The `index.ts` file defines types for `Pizza` and `Order`,  initializes a pizza menu, cash register, and an empty order queue.  Key functions include `addNewPizzatoMenu` to add pizzas to the menu, `placeOrder` to create and add orders to the queue (updating the cash register), and `completeOrder` to update the order status.

On June 15, 2025, at 2:24:59 PM, the file was updated.  This update added two new pizzas ("BBQ Chicken" and "Meat Lovers") to the menu using `addNewPizzatoMenu`. A Margarita pizza order was placed, and order ID 1 was subsequently completed using `completeOrder`. The final log statements display the updated menu, cash register balance (increased by the price of the Margarita), and the order queue with the completed order.  The code also shows a shift from using `Date.now()` for order IDs to a simpler incrementing `neworderId` variable.  There's evidence of refactoring in `completeOrder`, with a commented-out older implementation.
