# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

## 1:19:47 PM
The log shows the evolution of a TypeScript program managing a pizza menu and order queue.  Initially, the code included commented-out sections related to a Person and Address type, along with functions to display person details and manipulate an array of ages.  These were removed by 12:42:25 PM.

Between 12:25 PM and 12:27 PM, minor changes were made to the `ages` array type declaration, correcting type errors within the array.

The primary focus of development, starting around 12:42 PM, involved refining the `Pizza` and `Order` type definitions, and improving the `placeOrder` and `completeOrder` functions.  Specifically:

* **12:42 PM:** The commented-out Person and Address data was removed. The `orderQueue` type was corrected and the `placeOrder` function was made executable.
* **12:43 PM:** The `Order` type was explicitly defined, and the `neworderID` variable received a type annotation.  The commented-out Person and Address data remained removed.
* **12:44 PM - 12:45 PM:** No significant changes.
* **12:45 PM:** The `placeOrder` function was corrected to use `selectedPizza` in creating the order.
* **12:45 PM - 12:50 PM:** No significant changes.
* **12:50 PM:** The `completeORder` function was improved to include type checking for its input `id`.


The changes reflect a gradual refinement of the code, moving from a commented-out section with Person and Address data towards a more focused and type-safe implementation of the pizza order system.  The final version shows a complete pizza ordering system with clear type definitions and error handling.
