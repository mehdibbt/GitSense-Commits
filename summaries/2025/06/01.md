The commit on June 1st, 2025, at 11:28:18 AM, modifies `FlightSearch.jsx`.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the flight search results display and functionality within a React application.

**Key Changes:**

* **Improved Flight Data Handling:** The component now efficiently handles flight data fetching and rendering.  It uses Redux to manage state and utilizes `useSelector` and `useDispatch` for efficient state management.  The `fetchResult` function fetches flight data, updates Redux slices (`flightsSlice`, `flightSearchSlice`), and handles loading states. The component also includes pagination (`currentPage`, `flightsPerPage`) to display flight results efficiently.

* **Enhanced UI/UX:**  The UI includes loading indicators (`SearchLoader`), sidebars (`FlightSidebar`, `Sidebar`), and improved visual presentation of flight information (`AirSegments`, `FlightPrice`).  It uses Tailwind CSS for styling.  Refundability is indicated clearly by an icon and text.

* **Improved Data Processing:** The `getInitialAvailStrings` function processes flight data to extract relevant information (availability strings).  Error handling is included in `selectFlightHandeller`.

* **Navigation and Routing:** The component utilizes `useNavigate` for navigation to a cart page after flight selection. `useLocation` and `useSearchParams` are used for retrieving parameters from the URL.

* **Use of React Hooks:** Extensive use of React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo` is evident, demonstrating best practices for functional components.

**Recurring Elements:**

* Redux actions and selectors are used extensively throughout the component for managing flight data and UI state.
* Tailwind CSS classes are used for styling, indicating a consistent styling approach.
* The component follows a clear structure with well-commented code and functions, each with clear purpose and responsibility.


The changes significantly improve the functionality and user experience of the flight search component, incorporating robust data handling, efficient state management, and improved UI elements.
