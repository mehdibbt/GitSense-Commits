# Activity Summary for 6/16/2025

The log shows a series of modifications to a TypeScript project.  The `tsconfig.json` file underwent several revisions, primarily altering the compiler options.  Initially, numerous compiler options were commented out,  with `target` set to `"es2016"` and `"lib"` including `"es2016"` and `"dom"`.  Subsequent changes added `"es2015"` to `"lib"`, then further expanded `"lib"` to include `"es2017"` and `"esnext"`. Finally, the `tsconfig.json` was simplified, with only `"target"`, `"lib"`, `"module"`, and `"strict"` (set to `true`) remaining.  These changes suggest experimentation with different TypeScript configurations and a final decision to use a simpler, stricter setup targeting ES2015.  The changes happened between 12:24 PM and 1:18 PM on June 16, 2025.

The `index.ts` file initially contained commented-out code defining Pizza and Order types, along with functions to manage a pizza menu and order queue.  These comments were later removed in the final version of `index.ts`, which shows the pizza menu and order functions implemented and executed. A small snippet of code demonstrating the `arr.find()` method was also added and then removed. The `index.ts` file was modified between 12:28 PM and 1:15 PM on June 16, 2025, showing the evolution of the pizza ordering application logic.
