# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 1:04:28 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `index.ts` file.  Initially, the file contains code for managing a pizza menu, order queue, and cash register.  This includes functions to add pizzas to the menu (`addNewPizzatoMenu`), place orders (`placeOrder`), and complete orders (`completeORder`).  The `placeOrder` function had a bug in its initial versions where it would return early even if a pizza was found, this was fixed between 12:40PM and 12:42PM. Several consecutive edits between 12:38 PM and 12:39 PM show no actual code changes.

Around 12:40 PM, a type annotation was added to the `placeOrder` function's parameter.

At approximately 12:44 PM, the entire pizza-related code was commented out. Subsequently, the focus shifted to defining and instantiating a `Person` type.  The `Person` type definition evolved, initially requiring an address, then making the address optional (`address?:`),  and finally reverting back to requiring the address but correcting a syntax error. Multiple instances of `Person` objects (`person1`, `person2`, `person3`) were created, with variations in the presence and values of the `address` property.  The final version uses a separate `Address` type for better code organization.  The final code between 12:48PM and 12:49PM is consistent.  The changes between 12:44PM and 12:49PM show a complete shift in focus from pizza-related code to code dealing with persons and addresses.
