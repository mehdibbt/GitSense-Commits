# Activity Summary for 6/22/2025

The log shows modifications to `h:\wamp64\www\ts\1\index.js` on June 22, 2025, at 3:57:54 PM.  The JavaScript code implements a simple pizza ordering system.  Key functions include `addNewPizzatoMenu` to add pizzas to the menu, `placeOrder` to add an order to the queue and update the cash register, and `completeOrder` to mark an order as completed.  The code initializes with a sample menu, a starting cash register balance of 100, and an order ID counter.  Two new pizzas ("BBQ Chicken" and "Meat Lovers") are added to the menu using `addNewPizzatoMenu`. A "Margarita" pizza order is placed, and order number 1 is subsequently completed using `completeOrder`. Finally, the updated menu, cash register balance, and order queue are logged to the console.  The `completeOrder` function was modified to directly find and update the order's status, simplifying the previous implementation that used `findIndex`.  The use of `neworderID` provides a unique incremental ID for each order.
