# Activity Summary for 6/29/2025

## 5:24:09 PM
The log shows modifications to the file `example.ts` on June 29, 2025.  The file contains TypeScript code demonstrating various concepts.

The first two entries (4:16:29 PM and 4:16:54 PM)  are nearly identical, representing a very minor change.  The primary difference between these two versions is the addition of a single line at the end of the second entry: `const admin: UserAdmin = { name: "Cory", role: "admin" }`. This line declares a constant `admin` of type `UserAdmin`, which is an intersection type combining `User` and `Admin` types.

The third entry (4:20:39 PM) shows a further refinement of the `User` type.  An optional `age` property (`age?: number | undefined;`) has been added, allowing `User` objects to optionally include an age.  The rest of the code remains largely unchanged across all three entries; the initial sections define various types, interfaces, and functions related to shapes, vehicles, and users.  The commented-out code suggests experimentation with different array and type definitions.  The overall pattern suggests the developer is learning and experimenting with TypeScript features.
