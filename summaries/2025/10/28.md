# Activity Summary for 10/28/2025

## 1:51:03 PM
Over a span of approximately 50 minutes on October 28, 2025, significant development and refactoring occurred across components related to a "Booking List" interface in a Supabase CRM project. The changes primarily focused on enhancing filtering capabilities, refining table data presentation, and improving the user experience for managing bookings.

### File: `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingList\BookingList.jsx`

The `BookingList.jsx` component underwent several iterative changes.
*   **10/28/2025, 12:58:43 PM**: The `exportStatusTemplate` function was reactivated and modified to include an "example header row" alongside the actual data, likely for debugging export formatting. An artificial static example row with dummy booking data (all statuses `CONFIRMED`) was temporarily introduced into the `tableData` in `HandleSetApiResponse` to aid visualization or testing.
*   **10/28/2025, 12:59:19 PM**: The statuses within the temporary example row were briefly diversified (e.g., flight `CONFIRMED`, hotel `QUOTE`, transfer `NOT BOOKED`) before being reverted shortly after.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:01:43 PM**: The temporary static example row and its associated `console.log` statements were removed from `HandleSetApiResponse`, indicating the completion of that specific testing phase. The `fetchAllData` function was updated to correctly use `filterStartDate` and `filterEndDate` from the Formik values.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:03:32 PM**: The URL generation for the `actionColumn` was temporarily hardcoded to `admin/booking-details/B-13720533/` (using a static booking ID), which was likely a testing measure for a specific booking detail page.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:04:32 PM**: The `actionColumn`'s URL was corrected to dynamically use `data.basketId`, and the `id` prop was also set to `data.basketId`, ensuring that action buttons correctly link to the specific booking.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:13:51 PM - 1:13:57 PM**: A debugging `console.log(ta)` was added and then quickly corrected to `console.log(tableData)`.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:18:28 PM**: A significant structural change occurred when the imported filter component `FlightFilterBody` was replaced with `BookingFilterBody`, indicating a renaming or refactoring of the filter UI component.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:49:34 PM**: The `filterData` Formik `initialValues` were substantially revised. Fields like `flightRef`, `origin`, `destination`, `inboundDate`, `outboundDate` were removed, and new filter fields such as `basketId`, `clientName`, `clientEmail`, `status`, and `updated_at` were introduced. This marks a shift in the primary filtering options available for the booking list.

### File: `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\BookingList.js`

This configuration file defines the structure for the booking list and its associated filters.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:40:28 PM**: The `filter_info` object within `bookingListInfo` was updated to include a new filter field for `clientEmail`. Notably, the `status` filter still retained `fieldType: "date"`, which might be a legacy or misconfigured setting.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:44:23 PM**: A new constant object, `bookingListConstant`, was introduced. It defines `flightStatus` with various booking states (e.g., CONFIRMED, TICKETED, PENDING) and `taskPriority` options. This addition provides a centralized and reusable set of status options for the application.

### File: `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingList\BookingFilterBody.jsx`

This component is responsible for rendering the filter form.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:17:03 PM**: The initial version of `BookingFilterBody` (which had a conflicting `FlightFilterBody` comment) rendered filters for `updated_at` (date range), `flightRef`, `origin`, `outboundDate`, `destination`, `inboundDate`, and `company`. Debugging `console.log` statements were present.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:19:30 PM - 1:34:25 PM**: Import paths for `DateRangepicker` and `FilterDropDown` were initially removed or misconfigured and then corrected, indicating path adjustments during refactoring.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:37:00 PM**: The filter UI was significantly restructured. The `updated_at` date range picker, `flightRef`, `outboundDate`, `destination`, and `inboundDate` filters were removed. A `basketId` input filter was added. The `origin` and `company` filters remained.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:39:45 PM**: Further filter UI adjustments were made. The `origin` filter was changed to `clientName`, new `clientEmail` and `status` text input filters were added, and an `updated_at` single date picker was re-introduced, replacing the previously removed date range.
*   **10/28/2025, 1:44:45 PM**: The `status` filter was upgraded from a plain text input to a custom `Select` component. This `Select` component was integrated with the newly defined `bookingListConstant.flightStatus`, providing a structured dropdown for selecting booking statuses.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Filter System Overhaul**: A consistent pattern of refining and adapting the filtering system is evident across all changes, especially in `BookingList.jsx` and `BookingFilterBody.jsx`, driven by the `bookingListInfo` configuration. The shift moved from flight-specific filters (origin, destination, flightRef) to more general booking-centric filters (basketId, clientName, clientEmail, status).
*   **Dynamic UI Configuration**: The application heavily relies on configuration objects (`bookingListInfo`) to dynamically render UI elements like table columns and filter fields.
*   **Refactoring and Naming Conventions**: The renaming of `FlightFilterBody` to `BookingFilterBody` suggests an effort to align component names with their broader "Booking List" context rather than just "Flight" searches.
*   **Iterative Development**: Multiple small, sequential changes, including temporary debugging statements and hardcoded values, indicate an iterative development process for implementing and testing new features.
*   **Date Management**: `dayjs` is consistently used for handling and formatting dates across components.
