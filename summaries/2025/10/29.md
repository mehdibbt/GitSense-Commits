# Activity Summary for 10/29/2025

## 1:17:31 PM
The code changes primarily focus on refining the booking list filtering functionality and data handling. These updates occurred between 12:26 PM and 12:51 PM on October 29, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingList\BookingFilterBody.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:27:19 PM:** The filter field for client email was updated. Specifically, `filterInfo?.clientcontactEmailEmail.label` was corrected to `filterInfo?.contactEmail.label`, and the input's `name` and `value` attributes were changed from `clientEmail` to `contactEmail` (e.g., `filterData.values.clientEmail` became `filterData.values.contactEmail`).
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:28:26 PM:** Two `console.log` statements showing `filterInfo` and `filterData` were removed, indicating cleanup.
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:37:37 PM:** No significant code changes were introduced in this commit; the file remained consistent with the previous version after the console log removal.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\BookingList.js`**
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:27:28 PM:** The `filter_info` configuration within `bookingListInfo` was modified. The `clientEmail` field was renamed to `contactEmail`, and its label was updated from "client Email" to "Client Email".

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingList\BookingList.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:31:08 PM:**
        *   The `filterData` Formik `initialValues` were updated to reflect the `contactEmail` field, replacing `clientEmail`.
        *   The `fetchAllData` function's `formikPayload` was significantly refined. It began explicitly including `basketId`, `contactName`, `contactEmail`, and `flightStatus`. Date range fields were normalized from `updated_start_date`/`updated_end_date` to `filterStartDate`/`filterEndDate`, and a `type` field was removed from the payload.
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:32:43 PM:** The `flightStatus` field within the `formikPayload` in `fetchAllData` was updated to explicitly wrap its value in an array (`[values.flightStatus]`).
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:35:19 PM:** The handling of `flightStatus` in `formikPayload` was further improved to conditionally wrap the value in an array only if it's not already an array and not empty, making it more robust (`values.flightStatus ? Array.isArray(values.flightStatus) ? values.flightStatus : [values.flightStatus] : []`).
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:46:10 PM:** The `filterData` Formik `initialValues` were changed from `contactName` to `clientName` and `contactEmail` back to `clientEmail`. Notably, the `fetchAllData` function's `formikPayload` still inconsistently referenced `values.contactName` and `values.contactEmail` despite this change.
    *   **Timestamp 10/29/2025, 12:51:31 PM:** No discernible code changes were made in this entry compared to the previous one for this file.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Client/Contact Naming Convention Shift:** There's a notable pattern of renaming fields related to client/contact information (`clientEmail` to `contactEmail` and then `contactName`/`contactEmail` to `clientName`/`clientEmail`). This suggests an ongoing refinement or inconsistency in naming conventions across the CRM.
*   **Filter Logic Refinement:** Multiple changes were made to how filter values are constructed and passed in `BookingList.jsx`, particularly concerning date ranges and the `flightStatus` field, indicating efforts to make the filtering more robust and flexible.
*   **Code Cleanup:** The removal of `console.log` statements in `BookingFilterBody.jsx` suggests a phase of debugging completion or general code cleanup.
*   **Component-Constant Synchronization:** Changes in `BookingFilterBody.jsx` and `BookingList.js` were closely synchronized, reflecting updates to both the UI component and its underlying configuration constants.
