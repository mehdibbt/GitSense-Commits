# Activity Summary for 10/8/2025

## 1:29:13 PM
The provided log details recent development focusing on flight search functionalities and AI integration within a Supabase CRM client application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\features\Flight\flightsSlice.js`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (10/8/2025, 12:33:00 PM)**: This file established a Redux Toolkit slice for managing flight-related state. It defines an `initialState` including arrays for flights, filtered flights, airlines, airports, and various loading/error flags. Key asynchronous thunks were introduced for:
        *   `fetchFlights`: To search for flights via a `/getFares` endpoint.
        *   `fetchAirports`: To retrieve airport names.
        *   `fetchAirlines`: To retrieve airline names.
        *   `fetchFlighstData`: An orchestrating thunk that dispatches `fetchFlights` and `fetchAirlines` sequentially.
        *   `fetchFareRules`: To get fare details for a selected flight.
        *   `selectFlight`: To revalidate prices for a selected flight.
    *   The slice also includes standard reducers for modifying state properties like `isLoading`, `carrierCodes`, `stops`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `filteredFlights`, `selectedFlight`, and `fareRules`. `extraReducers` handle the lifecycle (pending, fulfilled, rejected) of all defined async thunks.
    *   **Endpoint Adjustments (10/8/2025, 12:39:06 PM, 12:41:13 PM, 12:41:58 PM)**: The `fetchAirports` thunk's API endpoint underwent multiple revisions within a short timeframe. Initially, it directly referenced `https://tse.travnet.tech/api/v1/getAirportNames`. It was then updated to use the `VITE_REACT_APP_TSE_URL` environment variable with `/api/v1/getAirportNames`, and finally refined to just `${import.meta.env.VITE_REACT_APP_TSE_URL}/getAirportNames`, suggesting a correction in the base path segment.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\AirSegments\AirportName.jsx`**:
    *   **Development and Refinement (10/8/2025, 12:35:14 PM, 12:36:48 PM, 12:37:03 PM)**: This React component is designed to display either an airport's name or its corresponding city name based on an IATA code.
    *   An initial change at `12:35:14 PM` had a placeholder for the display logic, effectively showing an empty string if no skeleton was active.
    *   This was quickly corrected at `12:36:48 PM` to correctly use `getAirportName[0]?.city` or `getAirportName[0]?.airportName` based on the `showCity` prop, along with a skeleton loader.
    *   A minor cleanup at `12:37:03 PM` involved removing a `console.log` statement.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Dashboard\Dashboard.jsx`**:
    *   **AI Feature Integration (10/8/2025, 12:53:58 PM)**: The Dashboard component was updated to include an AI prompt box. It integrates with a Supabase Edge Function to send user prompts and display AI replies. The initial implementation of `callOpenAI` used a hardcoded URL for the Supabase OpenAI function.
    *   **Endpoint Configuration Update (10/8/2025, 1:18:39 PM)**: The `callOpenAI` function was updated to use the `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` environment variable for the OpenAI function endpoint, making the application more flexible and configurable.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\supabase\functions\openai\index.ts`**:
    *   **Supabase Edge Function (10/8/2025, 1:25:17 PM)**: This file defines a Supabase Edge Function named `openai`. Its primary role is to act as an intermediary for calling the OpenAI API. It handles CORS preflight requests, authenticates incoming requests using a JWT token, extracts a user `prompt`, and then forwards this prompt to the `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, utilizing the `gpt-4o-mini` model. The OpenAI API key is fetched from Deno environment variables. It processes the OpenAI response and returns the AI's reply.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/8/2025, 12:33:00 PM**: Initial comprehensive setup of the `flightsSlice.js` Redux logic, including multiple async thunks for flight search and data retrieval.
*   **10/8/2025, 12:36:48 PM**: Correction to the `AirportName.jsx` component's display logic, ensuring airport or city names are correctly rendered.
*   **10/8/2025, 1:18:39 PM**: The `Dashboard.jsx` component's AI feature was updated to use a configurable environment variable for the Supabase OpenAI function endpoint.
*   **10/8/2025, 1:25:17 PM**: Definition of the `openai` Supabase Edge Function, enabling AI interaction via the OpenAI API.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Redux Toolkit Usage**: The `flightsSlice.js` extensively uses `@reduxjs/toolkit` for state management, `createAsyncThunk` for handling asynchronous operations, and `createSlice` for defining reducers and extra reducers.
*   **API Interactions**: Both client-side code (`flightsSlice.js`, `Dashboard.jsx`) and the serverless function (`openai\index.ts`) heavily rely on making HTTP POST requests to various APIs (`TSE_URL`, Supabase functions, OpenAI API).
*   **Environment Variable Configuration**: There's a clear pattern of externalizing API endpoints and sensitive keys (though keys are not summarized) using environment variables (`import.meta.env.*` and `Deno.env.get`), enhancing flexibility and security, with some initial inconsistencies being corrected.
*   **Error Handling**: `try...catch` blocks and `rejectWithValue` from Redux Toolkit are consistently used to manage and report errors during API calls and asynchronous operations.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Multiple minor updates and corrections to API endpoints and UI display logic occur within a short time frame, indicating active development and debugging.
