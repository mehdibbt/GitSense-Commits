# Activity Summary for 10/15/2025

## 1:19:24 PM
The provided log details a series of focused code changes primarily related to implementing and refining search history and detail views for flights and hotels within a Supabase CRM application. All modifications occurred on **October 15, 2025**, within a span of approximately one hour, indicating a concentrated development session.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\SearchHistory.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/15/2025, 12:23:30 PM)**
    *   Introduced the main `SearchHistory` component responsible for displaying flight and hotel search history.
    *   Implemented tab-based navigation (`Flights`, `Hotel`, with `Transfer` and `Attraction` tabs commented out) using `useState` to manage the active tab.
    *   Conditionally renders `FlightHistory` or `HotelHistory` components based on the active tab, passing authentication details (`authLoading`, `token`, `user`, `hasPermission`) to them.
    *   Uses `primereact/toast` for notifications and a `Pageheader` component for breadcrumbs and titles.

2.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/15/2025, 12:23:40 PM)**
    *   Developed the `FlightHistory` component to manage and display flight search records in a data table.
    *   Incorporated `formik` for handling filter form state, including initial values for company IDs based on the logged-in user.
    *   Manages various UI states such as loading, pagination, filter modal visibility, and data.
    *   Defines custom table cell templates for formatting dates (outbound, inbound, created/updated) and origin/destination details.
    *   Fetches flight data using `axiosTseInstance.post('/flightSearchResources')` with dynamic payload based on filter values.
    *   The `HandleSetApiResponse` function sorts received data by creation date.
    *   Renders filter controls (`ButtonFilter`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`), a `DataTableList`, and a `FilterModal` which contains the `FlightFilterBody`.

3.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightFilterBody.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/15/2025, 12:30:22 PM)**
    *   Created `FlightFilterBody` to render specific filter input fields for flight searches.
    *   Dynamically renders fields (e.g., date range for `updated_at`, text inputs for `flightRef`, `origin`, `destination`, `DatePicker` for `outboundDate` and `inboundDate`, and a `FilterDropDown` for `company` selection) based on a `filterInfo` configuration prop.
    *   Utilizes the `useFetchCompany` custom hook to retrieve company options for the dropdown.

4.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelFilterBody.jsx` (Timestamp: 10/15/2025, 12:30:51 PM)**
    *   Developed `HotelFilterBody`, which mirrors the structure and functionality of `FlightFilterBody` but is tailored for hotel search filters.
    *   Includes dynamic fields for `updated_at` (date range), `hotelRef` (text), `destination` (text), `checkIn` (DatePicker), `checkOut` (DatePicker), and `company` (dropdown) based on `filterInfo`.
    *   Also uses the `useFetchCompany` hook for company data.

5.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\constants.js` (Multiple timestamps between 10/15/2025, 12:34:59 PM and 10/15/2025, 12:39:38 PM)**
    *   This file saw multiple consecutive saves without visible code changes in the provided log snippets.
    *   It serves as a central location for various application constants, including:
        *   Prefixes, gender, currency definitions (old `Currency` object, new `currency` object with symbols, and `currency_symbol_list`).
        *   User menu paths.
        *   HTTP states and error codes/messages.
        *   Flight-specific constants (`cabinClasses`, `journeyTypes`).
        *   Utility functions (`priceFormattor`, `formatTime`).
        *   An extensive `colorPalette` object defining primary, secondary, text colors, and various color shades (blue, indigo, green, red, orange, purple, etc.), suggesting a theme or styling system.

6.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetails.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 10/15/2025, 12:38:11 PM and 10/15/2025, 12:57:19 PM)**
    *   Underwent significant development and refactoring during this period.
    *   **Initial state (12:38:11 PM):** A minimal placeholder component.
    *   **Rapid UI and Feature Integration (12:43:05 PM - 12:44:22 PM):**
        *   Introduced a detailed view panel with a heading for "Flight Details" (later updated to include "Reference: FLT-73771007").
        *   Added UI actions: Refresh, JSON Code view, and a "Follow/Unfollow" feature with avatar displays (later removed at 12:47:59 PM).
        *   Implemented collapsible sections for displaying form fields using `isCollapsed` state and icons (`MdExpandLess`, `MdExpandMore`).
        *   Integrated various input fields (`folder_id`, `client_id`, `start_date`, `due_date`, `task_priority`, `task_status`, `task_subject`, `assign_by`, `task_message_body`) which are dynamically rendered based on `editFieldInfo`.
        *   Utilizes `DatePicker` (Ant Design) and custom `Select` and `FilterDropDown` components.
    *   **Hook Integration & Formik Implementation (12:45:03 PM - 12:48:24 PM):**
        *   Integrated React Router hooks (`useParams`, `useNavigate`, `useLocation`) and custom authentication/user-fetching hooks (`useAuth`, `useFetchComUser`).
        *   Initialized numerous state variables to manage component behavior and data.
        *   Implemented a `toggleCollapse` function with a `setTimeout` for a smoother animation.
        *   Set up a `formik` instance (`formData`) with initial values for the form fields.
        *   The `onSubmit` logic for `formData` initially included a Supabase `update` operation for a 'tasks' table, referencing `editFieldInfo` keys and `user?.user_id` for updates, along with `dayjs` for timestamps and toast notifications. This indicates some re-purposing or mixed-concern logic in a `FlightDetails` component.
        *   The "Follow/Unfollow" feature and user avatar display were removed at **12:47:59 PM**.
    *   **API Call Refinement (12:50:22 PM - 12:57:19 PM):**
        *   Defined `HandleSetApiResponse` to process fetched data and populate component state and Formik values.
        *   The `fetchEditData` function was progressively refined:
            *   Initially a placeholder, then `fetchEditDataWithAdminSettings`.
            *   Changed to directly call `axiosInstance.post('/getFlightDetailsById')` (12:53:46 PM).
            *   Updated to use `axiosTseInstance` and pass `exportHeader` (12:54:25 PM, 12:55:17 PM).
            *   Finally, corrected to process `response.data[0]` (12:56:29 PM, 12:57:19 PM) and call `HandleSetApiResponse` correctly.
        *   An `useEffect` hook was added to trigger `fetchEditData` on component mount.
        *   References to `taskConstant` and `supabase` in the `formData.onSubmit` remain, suggesting some tasks-related logic is still intertwined or awaiting refactor in this flight-specific detail view.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Component Design:** Separation of concerns into parent views (`SearchHistory`), list views (`FlightHistory`), filter sub-components (`FlightFilterBody`, `HotelFilterBody`), and detail views (`FlightDetails`).
*   **React Hooks:** Heavy reliance on `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` for component state and lifecycle management.
*   **Form Management:** Consistent use of `formik` for handling form state, validation (though `validateOnChange: false` is set), and submission.
*   **Custom Hooks:** `useAuth`, `useFetchCompany`, `useFetchComUser` indicate a pattern of encapsulating common logic for authentication and data fetching.
*   **External UI Libraries:** `primereact`, `antd`, `flowbite-react`, and `react-icons` are used throughout for rich UI elements.
*   **Backend Communication:** `axiosTseInstance` (and `axiosInstance`) is the primary method for interacting with backend APIs, consistently using an `exportHeader`.
*   **Dynamic UI Rendering:** Components often conditionally render elements or form fields based on data (`editFieldInfo?.field_name?.type === '1'`).
*   **Styling Consistency:** Recurring use of class names like `panel`, `input-group`, `form-label`, `form__control` suggests a unified styling system (likely Tailwind CSS).
*   **Error and Success Handling:** The `formData.onSubmit` in `FlightDetails.jsx` includes `try-catch` blocks with calls to `showSuccess` and `showError` (presumably from a shared utility), indicating robust error handling.
*   **Time-based Development:** The concentrated timestamps suggest a dedicated effort on these specific features within a short timeframe.
