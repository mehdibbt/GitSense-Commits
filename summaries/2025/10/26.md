# Activity Summary for 10/26/2025

## 12:20:01 PM
The log details a series of changes primarily focused on two React components: `FlightDetails.jsx` and `FlightHistory.jsx`, with a subsequent introduction of `HotelHistory.jsx`. All modifications occurred on **October 26, 2025**.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetails.jsx`**

*   **10/26/2025, 11:28:27 AM**: Initial state of the `FlightDetails` component. It's a React component designed to display detailed flight search information, including fetching data from a backend API, user details from Supabase, and IP geolocation. It features a collapsible panel, "Search Again" functionality, and dynamically rendered fields. Technologies include React, Redux Toolkit, Supabase, Axios, Day.js, and various UI libraries.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:31:23 AM**: The entire component's code is commented out. This appears to be a temporary disabling or backup action.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:31:41 AM**: The component's code is uncommented, reverting the previous change. The content remains largely the same as the initial version, showing the UI structure for flight detail display.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:31:48 AM**: No functional changes. The file content is identical to the previous entry, likely a save operation.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:33:19 AM**: The component's code is again largely commented out, mirroring the action at 11:31:23 AM.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:34:18 AM**: The code is uncommented, and significant documentation and refinement are introduced.
    *   A comprehensive JSDoc-style component description is added.
    *   Detailed inline comments are added for hooks, state, functions, and handlers.
    *   Error handling (`try...catch`) is improved for API calls (`fetchEditData`, `userInfo`, `fetchLocation`).
    *   Console logs in `fetchLocation` and `userInfo` are commented out.
    *   Loading state (`setPageLoading`, `setBtnLoading`) calls are commented out, indicating they are temporarily disabled.
    *   A `if (!ip) return;` check is added to `fetchLocation` for early exit, and a fallback to display just the IP if geolocation fails.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:35:08 AM**: Further console logs related to IP fetching and user ID are commented out, continuing the cleanup of debug statements.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:35:56 AM**: Debugging-related `console.log` statements (for `editFieldInfo`, `data`, `locationData`) are temporarily re-introduced (uncommented) at a global level within the component logic.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:36:31 AM**: The debugging `console.log` statements added in the previous version are once again commented out.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:40:48 AM**: An import for a new UI icon, `IoIosArrowForward` from `react-icons/io`, is added.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:42:14 AM, 11:42:34 AM, 11:42:54 AM, 11:43:27 AM**: These entries show no functional code changes; they are identical to the 11:40:48 AM version, likely representing successive save operations.

**2. `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**

*   **10/26/2025, 11:54:42 AM**: Introduction of the `FlightHistory` component. This component displays a table of flight search history, allowing filtering and export. It uses Formik for form management, dynamically generates table columns, and includes specific templates for date and airport data. It fetches data from `/flightSearchResources` and uses `ExportDataTable` for export.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:55:43 AM**: The `ExportDataTable` component within the render section is commented out, temporarily disabling the data export functionality in the UI.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:56:01 AM**: The `ExportDataTable` component is uncommented, re-enabling export. A new state, `filteredData`, is introduced to manage data specifically for export when filters are active, ensuring the exported data reflects the current filtered view. The `HandleSetApiResponse` function is updated to set both `filteredData` and `exportData` with the sorted API response.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:12:36 PM**: The `filterData` Formik initial values are updated to include `outboundDate: ""`, adding this as a filterable field in the search history.

**3. `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelHistory.jsx`**

*   **10/26/2025, 12:04:49 PM**: Introduction of the `HotelHistory` component. This component is structurally very similar to `FlightHistory`, but tailored for hotel search history. Key differences include:
    *   Uses `defaultSearchHotelList` for configuration.
    *   Has hotel-specific table cell templates (`checkInTemplate`, `checkOutTemplate`, `destinationTemplate`, `dayCountTemplate`).
    *   Calls the `/hotelSearchResources` API.
    *   Uses `HotelFilterBody` for its filter modal.
    *   **Potential issue**: The `actionColumn` URL is `search-details-flight/${data.hotelSearchId}`, which seems like a copy-paste error and should likely be `search-details-hotel`.
    *   Lacks the "Refresh" button seen in `FlightHistory`.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:17:43 PM**: The `filterData` Formik `initialValues` are modified. `inboundDate` and `outboundDate` are added, and several commented-out fields (like `filterStartDate`, `type`, `origin`, `flightRef`) are present, suggesting an attempt to align filter options with `FlightHistory` or a partial merge.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent File Structuring**: Components are organized by `Interface/SearchDetails` for individual entry views and `Interface/SearchHistory` for list views.
*   **Repeated Commenting/Uncommenting**: In `FlightDetails.jsx`, there's a recurring pattern of commenting out the entire component or large sections and then uncommenting them, suggesting a workflow of temporarily disabling or backing up code during active development or debugging.
*   **Emphasis on Documentation**: The addition of detailed JSDoc comments to `FlightDetails.jsx` and their presence in other files indicates a focus on code readability and maintainability.
*   **Standardized State Management**: `useState` is consistently used for managing UI states (e.g., loading, collapse, filter visibility) and data states (e.g., `data`, `tableData`, `exportData`).
*   **Centralized API Interaction**: `axiosTseInstance.post` is the primary method for communicating with the backend API, using a consistent `exportHeader`. Supabase is used for user data. A third-party IP geolocation API is integrated in `FlightDetails`.
*   **Reusable UI Components**: The project heavily utilizes a set of custom or imported UI components for consistency, such as `Button`, `PageLoader`, `Tooltip`, `ButtonFilter`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`, `DataTableList`, `FilterModal`, `ActionColumnTemplate`, and `ExportDataTable`.
*   **Formik for Form Handling**: `Formik` is consistently employed for managing form state, validation, and submission, particularly in the history/filter components.
*   **Dynamic Table Generation**: Both `FlightHistory` and `HotelHistory` use a `generateTableColumns` utility function and configuration objects (`defaultSearchFlightList`, `defaultSearchHotelList`) to dynamically set up table headers and display data.
*   **Debugging Practices**: There's a clear pattern of adding `console.log` statements for debugging and then commenting them out (or entirely removing them in later changes) for cleanup.
*   **Error Handling Consistency**: `try...catch` blocks are consistently implemented for API calls across components, and `console.error` is used for logging errors.
*   **Potential for Copy-Paste Errors**: The initial implementation of `HotelHistory.jsx` closely mirrors `FlightHistory.jsx`, leading to a probable copy-paste error in the `actionColumn` URL which links to a flight detail page instead of a hotel detail page. This pattern is also hinted at in the commented-out `initialValues` in `HotelHistory`.

## 1:20:10 PM
For `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetails.jsx`:

*   **10/26/2025, 11:28:27 AM**: This file initializes the `FlightDetails` React component, designed to display detailed information about a specific flight search. It includes features like fetching flight details, user information from Supabase, IP geolocation, collapsible panels, and a "Search Again" function that utilizes Redux for airport data and React Router for navigation. The component leverages Axios for API calls and Day.js for date handling.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:31:23 AM & 10/26/2025, 11:33:19 AM**: The entire content of the file was commented out, indicating a temporary disabling or preparatory step for significant changes.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:31:41 AM & 10/26/2025, 11:34:18 AM**: The code was uncommented, restoring its functionality. The 11:34:18 AM update also introduced a comprehensive JSDoc block describing the component's purpose, features, and technical stack.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:35:08 AM & 10/26/2025, 11:36:31 AM**: Minor changes involved commenting out and re-enabling `console.log` statements for debugging purposes, particularly related to IP fetching and user info.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:40:48 AM**: A new icon (`IoIosArrowForward`) was imported, suggesting planned UI enhancements.
*   Subsequent timestamps (11:42:14 AM, 11:42:34 AM, 11:42:54 AM, 11:43:27 AM) show no functional code changes, likely representing minor formatting saves.

For `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`:

*   **10/26/2025, 11:54:42 AM**: This file establishes the `FlightHistory` component for displaying flight search records in a data table, featuring filters, date range selection, and an export option. It uses Formik for form management, `axiosTseInstance` for API calls to `/flightSearchResources`, and dynamically generates table columns. There was an initial oversight where `filteredData` was used in JSX but not declared in state.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:55:43 AM**: The `ExportDataTable` component was temporarily commented out from the UI.
*   **10/26/2025, 11:56:01 AM**: The `ExportDataTable` was uncommented, restoring export functionality. Crucially, a `filteredData` state variable was formally added and populated, resolving the previous potential issue.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:12:36 PM**: The Formik `initialValues` and the API payload for `fetchAllData` were updated to include `outboundDate` for enhanced filtering.

For `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelHistory.jsx`:

*   **10/26/2025, 12:04:49 PM**: This file introduced the `HotelHistory` component, mirroring much of the structure of `FlightHistory` but adapted for hotel search history. It utilized Formik for filters, displayed data in a table, and included an export feature. The initial implementation contained a copy-paste error where the action column URL incorrectly pointed to a flight details page, and the `formikPayload` for data fetching still contained flight-specific fields (e.g., `type`, `origin`, `outboundDate`).
*   **10/26/2025, 12:32:33 PM**: The Formik instance variable name was refactored from `filterData` to `hotelFilterData` for better clarity within the component.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:37:16 PM**: Partial correction of the `formikPayload` was made, changing `flightRef` to `hotelRef` and commenting out some flight-specific fields, though some remained.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:38:16 PM**: The entire API data fetching logic (`axiosTseInstance.post`) within `fetchAllData` was temporarily commented out, effectively pausing data retrieval for debugging.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:40:52 PM**: The API data fetching was re-enabled, and the `hotelRef` field in the `formikPayload` was fully corrected.

For `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelFilterBody.jsx`:

*   **10/26/2025, 12:19:47 PM**: This component defined the filter body for hotel searches. It contained a bug where `DatePicker` components for "Check In" and "Check Out" incorrectly referenced flight-specific field names (`outboundDate`, `inboundDate`) from `filterInfo`.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:26:21 PM**: The "Check In" `DatePicker` was corrected to properly use `filterInfo?.checkIn.field` and `label`.
*   **10/26/2025, 12:27:26 PM**: The "Check Out" `DatePicker` was similarly corrected to use `filterInfo?.checkOut.field` and `label`, resolving the date field naming inconsistencies.
*   `console.log` statements were intermittently added/removed for debugging purposes (e.g., 12:21:24 PM, 12:23:04 PM).

For `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchHotelList.js`:

*   **10/26/2025, 12:46:11 PM**: This file defines the configuration for hotel search lists and filters. It lists relevant table columns and filterable fields. Notably, the `filter_info` section still includes flight-specific field names (`outboundDate`, `inboundDate`) alongside hotel-specific ones, indicating an incomplete alignment with hotel search terminology.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration and Debugging**: There's a strong pattern of very frequent saves (often within seconds or a few minutes) across all modified files, frequently involving commenting/uncommenting large blocks of code or `console.log` statements. This suggests an active, iterative development and debugging process.
*   **Code Duplication and Correction**: Components initially shared significant code patterns, especially between `FlightHistory` and `HotelHistory`, leading to copy-paste errors (e.g., flight-specific field names in hotel contexts). These errors were progressively identified and corrected across `HotelHistory.jsx` and `HotelFilterBody.jsx`, demonstrating a refinement process.
*   **Component-Based UI**: Both history components (`FlightHistory`, `HotelHistory`) heavily utilize reusable UI components for filters, data tables, date pickers, and modals, promoting consistency and reusability.
*   **Data Management**: A consistent approach to data fetching is observed: using Formik for filter state, `axiosTseInstance.post` for API calls, and dedicated `HandleSetApiResponse` functions to process and sort data.
*   **Configuration-Driven UI**: Filter and table column definitions are driven by configuration objects (`defaultSearchFlightList`, `defaultSearchHotelList`), allowing for flexible UI generation.
*   **Naming Refinement**: A clear attempt to improve code readability and specificity was made by renaming `filterData` to `hotelFilterData` in `HotelHistory.jsx`.

## 2:20:01 PM
The code changes primarily involve two React components related to search history and details: `FlightDetails.jsx` and `FlightHistory.jsx` (for flight searches), and `HotelHistory.jsx` and `HotelFilterBody.jsx` (for hotel searches), along with a constant configuration file `SearchHotelList.js` and a general `constants.js`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetails.jsx`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 11:28:27 AM - 11:31:48 AM (and repeated at 11:33:19 AM - 11:36:31 AM):** The file content repeatedly toggled between fully implemented code and almost entirely commented-out code. This suggests extensive debugging, temporary reverts, or issues with version control during development. The initial comprehensive version included features like fetching flight details, user details from Supabase, IP geolocation, collapsible panels, and "Search Again" functionality.
    *   **10/26/2025, 11:34:18 AM:** A detailed JSDoc comment block was added, formalizing the component's description, features, and technologies used. `console.log` statements for debugging `ip` were commented out.
    *   **10/26/2025, 11:35:56 AM:** Debugging `console.log` statements for `editFieldInfo`, `data`, and `locationData` were temporarily added/uncommented.
    *   **10/26/2025, 11:40:48 AM:** The `IoIosArrowForward` icon was imported.
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:12:35 PM:** A critical functional error was introduced where `fetchEditData` was temporarily modified to call a hotel-specific API endpoint (`/getHotelDetailsByID` using `hotel_search_id`) instead of the correct flight endpoint.
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:15:08 PM - 2:19:18 PM:** The functional error introduced at 2:12:35 PM was corrected, reverting the `fetchEditData` function to correctly use the flight-specific API endpoint (`/getFlightDetailsById` with `flight_search_id`).

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 11:54:42 AM:** The `FlightHistory` component was implemented, providing a table display of flight search history with filtering, pagination, and data export capabilities. It uses `useFormik` for filter form management.
    *   **10/26/2025, 11:55:43 AM:** The `ExportDataTable` component and its rendering condition were temporarily commented out, disabling data export.
    *   **10/26/2025, 11:56:01 AM:** The `ExportDataTable` component was re-enabled.
    *   **10/26/2025, 11:59:00 AM:** A new state variable `filteredData` was introduced to manage data specifically for export when filtering is active.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:12:36 PM:** The `outboundDate` field was added to the Formik `initialValues` and `formikPayload`, enabling filtering by outbound date.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelHistory.jsx`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:04:49 PM:** The `HotelHistory` component was introduced, mirroring much of the structure of `FlightHistory` but adapted for hotel search data, including specific date formatting templates (`checkInTemplate`, `checkOutTemplate`) and a `dayCountTemplate`. It fetches data from `/hotelSearchResources`.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:17:43 PM:** Formik `initialValues` included flight-specific fields like `inboundDate` and `outboundDate`, indicating a copy-paste from flight-related components.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:32:33 PM:** The Formik instance `filterData` was renamed to `hotelFilterData` for clarity.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:37:16 PM:** The `formikPayload` was seen to contain several flight-specific fields (`type`, `flightRef`, `origin`, `outboundDate`, `inboundDate`) which were likely carried over from a flight component.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:38:16 PM:** Data fetching via `axiosTseInstance.post` was temporarily commented out in `fetchAllData`, effectively disabling API calls for this component. A debugging `console.log` was added.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:39:01 PM:** Data fetching was re-enabled. The `hotelRef` field in `formikPayload` was corrected to use `values.hotelRef`, but some flight-specific payload fields (`origin`, `outboundDate`, `inboundDate`) remained.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:40:52 PM:** The `formikPayload` structure was refined to explicitly include `hotelRef: values.hotelRef || ""`, though some irrelevant flight-related fields (`origin`, `outboundDate`, `inboundDate`) persisted in the payload definition.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelFilterBody.jsx`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:19:47 PM:** Initial implementation of the filter body for hotel searches. It contained a bug where `checkIn` and `checkOut` date pickers were incorrectly bound to `filterInfo?.outboundDate.field` and `filterInfo?.inboundDate.field` respectively.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:23:04 PM:** A debugging `console.log('Filter Data:', filterData)` was added.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:26:21 PM:** The binding for the `checkIn` date picker was corrected to use `filterInfo?.checkIn.field`.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:27:26 PM:** The binding for the `checkOut` date picker was corrected to use `filterInfo?.checkOut.field`, resolving the primary bug in this component.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchHotelList.js`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:46:11 PM:** This file was updated to define the list and filter configurations for hotel searches. Notably, the `filter_info` section included `outboundDate` and `inboundDate` fields (flight-related names) with "Checkin Date" and "Checkout Date" labels (hotel-related semantics).

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\constants.js`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:05:56 PM:** This file saw a significant update, including the addition/refinement of several constant objects such as `Currency`, `currency`, `currency_symbol_list`, `HTTP_STATES`, `ERROR_STATUS`, `ERROR_MESSAGE`, `cabinClasses`, `journeyTypes`, `priceFormattor`, `formatTime`, and a large `colorPalette`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Activity:** There's a clear pattern of adding and removing `console.log` statements, and temporarily commenting out significant code blocks (`FlightDetails.jsx`, `HotelHistory.jsx`), indicating active debugging and development cycles.
*   **Code Duplication/Copy-Paste:** Several instances suggest code was copied between `Flight` and `Hotel` components (e.g., flight-specific filter fields appearing in `HotelHistory.jsx`'s `initialValues` and `formikPayload`, and incorrect date picker bindings in `HotelFilterBody.jsx`). These were subsequently identified and partially/fully corrected.
*   **Modularity and Configuration:** Components heavily rely on external configuration objects (like `defaultSearchFlightList` and `defaultSearchHotelList`) for defining table columns and filter fields, promoting reusability and easier updates.
*   **State Management:** Consistent use of `useState` and `useRef` for local component state, and `useDispatch` from Redux for global state (e.g., fetching airports).
*   **UI Frameworks/Libraries:** Frequent imports from `flowbite-react` (Tooltip), `react-icons` for various UI elements, and `antd` (DatePicker) indicate a standardized UI toolkit.
*   **Date Handling:** `dayjs` is consistently used for date manipulation and formatting.
*   **API Interaction:** `axios` and `axiosTseInstance` (likely a custom Axios instance) are used for backend API calls, with `exportHeader` being a recurring header configuration. Supabase is used for user data fetching.

## 3:19:32 PM
The provided log details changes across three files, focusing on React components for displaying flight and hotel search details, and a utility file for hotel search configuration.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetails.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/26/2025, 11:28:27 AM - 10/26/2025, 2:26:57 PM
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   Initially, the file defines a `FlightDetails` component that fetches and displays flight search data, user details, and IP geolocation. It includes functionality to "Search Again" using Redux and navigates to a search page with pre-filled data. It also supports collapsing/expanding the detail panel and dynamic rendering of form fields based on `defaultSearchFlightList.update_info`.
        *   Between 11:31:23 AM and 11:34:18 AM, there were several instances of commenting out and uncommenting the entire component's code, or large sections of it. This suggests a period of active debugging, testing, or temporary disabling of features.
        *   Around 11:34:18 AM, a comprehensive JSDoc comment was added at the top, explaining the component's purpose, features, and technologies used. This significantly improved code documentation.
        *   Minor console log statements (e.g., `console.log(data)`) were occasionally uncommented or commented out for debugging.
        *   Around 11:40:48 AM, a new icon `IoIosArrowForward` was imported, though its usage in the provided snippets isn't immediately visible.
        *   At 2:20:35 PM, the `pageLoading` state's initial value was explicitly set to `true`, and `setPageLoading(false)` was added to the `HandleSetApiResponse` function, indicating a more explicit management of page loading indicators.

2.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/26/2025, 11:54:42 AM - 10/26/2025, 12:12:36 PM
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This component manages and displays a history of flight searches, featuring a data table with dynamic columns, filtering capabilities using Formik, and export functionality.
        *   Around 11:55:43 AM, the `ExportDataTable` component was temporarily commented out from the JSX rendering, only to be uncommented at 11:56:01 AM. This indicates a brief test or decision phase regarding the export feature's visibility.
        *   At 11:59:00 AM, a new state `[filteredData, setFilteredData]` was introduced to store filtered table data, and `setFilteredData(sortedData || [])` was added to `HandleSetApiResponse` alongside `setTableData` and `setExportData`. This change likely enables separate management of displayed table data vs. export data after filtering.
        *   Around 12:12:36 PM, the `filterData` Formik initial values were updated to include `outboundDate` as a filter field, expanding the search criteria.

3.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelHistory.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/26/2025, 12:04:49 PM - 10/26/2025, 2:06:44 PM
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This component parallels `FlightHistory.jsx` but for hotel search history. It also uses Formik for filtering and displays data in a table with custom column templates (e.g., `checkInTemplate`, `dayCountTemplate`).
        *   A significant change occurred at 12:17:43 PM where several commented-out `initialValues` in the `filterData` Formik configuration were cleaned up, clarifying the active filter fields.
        *   Between 12:32:33 PM and 12:33:06 PM, the `filterData` variable for Formik was renamed to `hotelFilterData` for better clarity within the `HotelHistory` component, and its usages were updated accordingly.
        *   Around 12:37:16 PM, there was a cleanup in the `formikPayload` within `fetchAllData`, where commented-out fields from an earlier iteration (likely copied from `FlightHistory`) were removed, and the `hotelRef` mapping was corrected from `values.flightRef` to `values.hotelRef`.
        *   Between 12:38:16 PM and 12:40:52 PM, the `try...catch` block around the `axiosTseInstance.post` call in `fetchAllData` was temporarily commented out and then re-enabled, suggesting debugging related to API calls or error handling.
        *   At 2:06:44 PM, the `url` for the `ActionColumnTemplate` was updated from `/admin/search-details-flight/${data.hotelSearchId}` to `/admin/search-details-hotel/${data.hotelSearchId}`, correcting a potential routing error to display hotel details.

4.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelFilterBody.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/26/2025, 12:19:47 PM - 10/26/2025, 12:47:21 PM
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This component provides the filter UI for `HotelHistory`.
        *   Between 12:19:47 PM and 12:26:21 PM, the `DatePicker` fields for `checkIn` and `checkOut` in the filter form were corrected. Initially, they were incorrectly referencing `filterInfo?.outboundDate.field` and `filterInfo?.inboundDate.field` respectively (which are flight-related terms). This was fixed to correctly use `filterInfo?.checkIn.field` and `filterInfo?.checkOut.field`.
        *   Around 12:23:04 PM, a `console.log('Filter Data:', filterData)` was added for debugging.
        *   At 12:47:21 PM, the labels `filterInfo?.checkIn.label` and `filterInfo?.checkOut.label` were also updated to use `filterInfo?.outboundDate.label` and `filterInfo?.inboundDate.label` respectively, aligning them with the field names defined in `defaultSearchHotelList.js` for "Checkin Date" and "Checkout Date" under `filter_info`.

5.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchHotelList.js`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/26/2025, 12:46:11 PM - 10/26/2025, 2:41:41 PM
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This file defines the configuration for hotel search lists and update forms.
        *   At 2:35:10 PM, a new `update_info` section was added, providing detailed metadata (field names, labels, types, default values) for various hotel-related properties like `hotel_ref`, `ip_address`, `destinationName`, `checkIn`, `checkOut`, `adults`, `children`, `infants`, etc. This enables dynamic form rendering for hotel details, similar to what `FlightDetails` uses.

6.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\constants.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/26/2025, 2:05:56 PM
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   The `blue2` color shade definitions within the `colorPalette` object were updated. Specifically, the `500` and `800` shades for `blue2` were changed from `#3b82f6` and `#1e40af` to `#2a3ead`. This indicates a minor adjustment to the application's color scheme for `blue2`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Timestamp Consistency:** All changes occurred on the same day, 10/26/2025, indicating focused development or a single session of work.
*   **React Component Structure:** The `FlightDetails` and `HotelHistory` components follow a similar structure with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useParams`, `useLocation`, `useNavigate`, `useDispatch`), API calls (`axiosTseInstance.post`), state management, and UI rendering.
*   **Dynamic UI Generation:** Both `FlightDetails` and `HotelHistory` (and its associated filter body) rely heavily on configuration objects (`defaultSearchFlightList`, `defaultSearchHotelList`) to dynamically render form fields and table columns. This promotes reusability and easier configuration.
*   **Formik for Filtering:** `FlightHistory` and `HotelHistory` consistently use `useFormik` for managing filter form states, including initial values, validation (though `validateOnChange` is false), and submission handling.
*   **API Interactions:** Both detail and history components make `axiosTseInstance.post` calls to backend endpoints (`/getFlightDetailsById`, `/getHotelDetailsByID`, `/flightSearchResources`, `/hotelSearchResources`) and include `exportHeader` for authentication.
*   **Geolocation Integration:** The `fetchLocation` function, utilizing `https://ip-get-geolocation.com/api/json/${ip}`, is a common pattern in the detail components to enrich user data with geographical information.
*   **UI Components:** Repeated use of custom UI components like `Button`, `PageLoader`, `Tooltip`, `ButtonFilter`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`, `DataTableList`, `ActionColumnTemplate`, `FilterModal`, and `ExportDataTable` is evident across the history components.
*   **Debugging Practices:** Frequent commenting/uncommenting of `console.log` statements and sometimes large blocks of code, especially in `FlightDetails.jsx` and `HotelHistory.jsx`, indicates an iterative debugging approach.
*   **Refactoring and Renaming:** The renaming of `filterData` to `hotelFilterData` in `HotelHistory.jsx` signifies refactoring for improved component-specific clarity.
*   **Error Handling:** `try...catch` blocks are consistently used around API calls for robust error handling, with `console.error` for logging issues.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `formatDate` utility function and `dayjs` library are consistently used for date manipulation and display.
*   **Shared Icons:** Icons from `react-icons` (e.g., `HiOutlineRefresh`, `MdExpandLess`, `MdExpandMore`, `IoChevronBackCircleOutline`, `FaPlane`, `IoIosArrowForward`) are reused across different components for consistent UI actions.

## 4:19:34 PM
The provided logs indicate a focused development effort on refining the search history and detail view functionalities within a `supabase-crm` application, specifically for flight and hotel searches.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetails.jsx` (and its page wrapper `FlightDetailsPage.jsx`)**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/26/2025, 11:42:34 AM - 10/26/2025, 11:43:27 AM (minor code duplication, likely formatting/saving), and then 10/26/2025, 2:15:08 PM - 10/26/2025, 3:28:22 PM (significant changes and refactoring).
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **Refactoring & Documentation:** A major shift occurred where the `FlightDetails` component was moved from `src/pages/backend/Interface/SearchDetails` to `src/components/Backend/Interface/SearchDetails`, indicating a move towards better component organization and reusability. Comprehensive JSDoc comments were added to the component, detailing its purpose, dependencies, features, and usage.
        *   **Initial `pageLoading` state:** The `pageLoading` state was consistently set to `true` on initialization and then to `false` within `HandleSetApiResponse`, ensuring a loading indicator is displayed while data is fetched.
        *   **Unused States Removal:** States like `follow`, `openFilter`, `activeTab`, `toast`, and `hasToastShown` were marked as "unused" or commented out in their functionality, simplifying the component's state management.
        *   **IP Geolocation:** The `fetchLocation` function, which fetches geographical data based on an IP address using `https://ip-get-geolocation.com/api/json/${ip}`, remained consistent across revisions.
        *   **User Info Fetch:** The `userInfo` function to fetch user details from Supabase also remained consistent.
        *   **`handleSearchAgain` logic:** This function prepares existing search data (origin, destination, airport details) and navigates to the `/admin/search` page, effectively allowing a user to re-initiate a past search.
        *   **Component comments on reusability:** The documentation explicitly notes that despite being named `FlightDetails`, this component's structure and even some API calls (`/getHotelDetailsByID`) suggest it might be reused or misnamed, hinting at a potential architectural decision or copy-paste scenario.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/26/2025, 11:54:42 AM - 10/26/2025, 12:12:36 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **`ExportDataTable` visibility:** The `ExportDataTable` component was temporarily commented out from the JSX rendering at 11:55:43 AM and then uncommented again at 12:01:01 PM.
        *   **`filteredData` state:** A new `filteredData` state was introduced at 11:59:00 AM, likely to hold the data after local filtering operations for export purposes.
        *   **Payload for `fetchAllData`:** The `formikPayload` was updated at 12:12:36 PM to include `outboundDate` and `inboundDate` fields, making the filter more comprehensive.
        *   **API response handling:** The `HandleSetApiResponse` now explicitly sets both `filteredData` and `exportData` to the `sortedData`.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\HotelHistory\HotelHistory.jsx` (and its filter body `HotelFilterBody.jsx`)**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/26/2025, 12:04:49 PM - 10/26/2025, 12:40:52 PM (HotelHistory), and 10/26/2025, 12:19:47 PM - 10/26/2025, 12:27:26 PM (HotelFilterBody).
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **Component Duplication/Adaptation:** `HotelHistory` largely mirrors `FlightHistory` in its structure and functionality (state management, API fetching, table column definitions using `generateTableColumns`, Formik integration for filters).
        *   **Filter Formik Initial Values:** The `initialValues` for `hotelFilterData` in `HotelHistory` were updated and refined across several commits to include `destination`, `hotelRef`, `checkIn`, `checkOut`, and `company`. There was also a temporary commented-out section of flight-related filter fields, suggesting a copy-paste and adaptation process.
        *   **`fetchAllData` payload:** The payload for `/hotelSearchResources` in `HotelHistory` was modified at 12:37:16 PM, where `hotelRef` was incorrectly mapped from `values.flightRef` (a bug) and then corrected to `values.hotelRef` at 12:40:52 PM. Other payload fields like `origin`, `outboundDate`, `inboundDate`, and `type` were present in the `formikPayload` for hotel search, but commented out in the initialValues, indicating a potential mismatch or future plan for these fields in hotel search.
        *   **`HotelFilterBody` updates:** The `DatePicker` components within `HotelFilterBody` were updated to correctly reference `filterInfo?.checkIn.field` and `filterInfo?.checkOut.field` for their `value` and `setFieldValue` calls, fixing a bug where they were incorrectly using `filterInfo?.outboundDate.field` and `filterInfo?.inboundDate.field` respectively (corrected at 12:26:21 PM and 12:27:26 PM).
        *   **API Endpoint:** Confirmed use of `/hotelSearchResources` for fetching hotel history.
        *   **Navigation URL:** The `ActionColumnTemplate` was updated to point to `/admin/search-details-hotel/${data.hotelSearchId}`.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchHotelList.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/26/2025, 12:46:11 PM - 10/26/2025, 2:41:41 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:** This file defines the structure for `defaultSearchHotelList`, including `list_config` (columns for the table) and `filter_info` (fields for the filter modal). At 2:35:10 PM, a new `update_info` section was added, providing metadata for detail view fields like `hotel_ref`, `ip_address`, `destinationName`, `checkIn`, `checkOut`, `adults`, `children`, `infants`, etc., along with example `value`s. This `update_info` is crucial for the `HotelDetails` component.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\constants.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/26/2025, 2:05:56 PM and 10/26/2025, 3:46:46 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:** No functional code changes. The content provided for both timestamps is identical, indicating no changes to constants like `namePrefixes`, `gender`, `Currency`, `userMenus`, `HTTP_STATES`, `ERROR_MESSAGE`, `cabinClasses`, `journeyTypes`, `priceFormattor`, `currency`, `currency_symbol_list`, `formatTime`, or `colorPalette`.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\SearchHistory.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 10/26/2025, 3:25:39 PM - 10/26/2025, 4:15:31 PM.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **`useSearchParams` hook:** Imported `useSearchParams` to manage tab state via URL query parameters, improving navigability and bookmarking.
        *   **`useEffect` for URL sync:** Added an `useEffect` hook to synchronize the `activeTab` state with the `type` query parameter in the URL.
        *   **Tab-based Navigation:** Implemented a robust tab navigation system (Flights, Hotel) where clicking a tab updates both the internal `activeTab` state and the URL query parameter using `setSearchParams`.
        *   **Documentation:** Comprehensive JSDoc comments were added at 4:15:31 PM to detail the component's purpose, features, dependencies, and usage.

**General Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Consistent File Structure:** Search history components (`FlightHistory`, `HotelHistory`) follow a similar pattern:
    *   State management with `useState` (for loading, data, filters, pagination).
    *   `useFormik` for filter forms.
    *   `useMemo` for optimizing table column generation.
    *   `useEffect` for initial data fetching and dependency-based re-fetches.
    *   `HandleSetApiResponse` function to process and set fetched data.
    *   `fetchAllData` function to make API calls using `axiosTseInstance`.
    *   `ActionColumnTemplate` for view/edit/delete actions.
2.  **Date Formatting:** `dayjs` and `formatDate` utility are consistently used for date manipulation and display across both flight and hotel components.
3.  **Authentication and Permissions:** `useAuth` hook and `hasPermission` function are passed as props to history components, indicating a centralized authentication and authorization system.
4.  **UI Components:** Reusable UI components like `ButtonFilter`, `DataTableList`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`, `FilterModal`, and `ExportDataTable` are prevalent.
5.  **API Interaction:** `axiosTseInstance.post` with `exportHeader` is the standard for backend API calls.
6.  **Geolocation Service:** `https://ip-get-geolocation.com/api/json/${ip}` is used consistently for IP geolocation in detail views.
7.  **Supabase Integration:** Supabase is used to fetch user details based on `user_id` in detail views.
8.  **Loading States:** `pageLoading` and `btnLoading` states are used to manage UI feedback during data fetches or button clicks.
9.  **Refactoring and Documentation:** There's a clear pattern of adding detailed JSDoc comments to components, especially when component logic is moved or adapted, indicating a commitment to maintainable code.
10. **Console Logging for Debugging:** Multiple `console.log` statements (e.g., `console.log("Flight History Table Data:", filtering);`, `console.log(filterData)`, `console.log("ASdasd" , values)`) are present throughout the code, suggesting active debugging during development.
11. **Component Naming Inconsistencies:** The `HotelDetails.jsx` component still contains comments and module names referring to `FlightDetails` (e.g., `@module FlightDetails`, `@fileoverview FlightDetails component displays...`), even after being adapted for hotel details and renamed to `HotelDetails`, highlighting a potential copy-paste origin or an ongoing refactor. Similarly, the `handleSearchAgain` function in `HotelDetails.jsx` still attempts to `dispatch(fetchAirports(airportCodes))` and navigates to `/admin/search`, which is flight-specific logic, even though the component is for hotels.

## 5:20:10 PM
The provided log details a series of changes focused on the `supabase-crm` project, primarily affecting its backend interface for search history and search details, alongside updates to constants and a new booking list component. The changes occurred on October 26, 2025, between 12:17 PM and 4:36 PM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

    *   **10/26/2025, 12:17:43 PM:** Initial commit of a comprehensive `HotelHistory` component. This component includes state management for filtering, pagination, data tables, and export. It defines table column templates, uses Formik for filter forms, fetches data via `axiosTseInstance` to `/hotelSearchResources`, and renders various UI components for filtering and data display. The action column initially linked to flight details, indicating a potential copy-paste.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:32:33 PM - 12:33:06 PM:** The Formik instance name was temporarily mistyped as `hotelhotelFilterData` before being corrected to `hotelFilterData`.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:37:16 PM:** Corrected a bug in the `fetchAllData` payload where `hotelRef` was incorrectly mapped from `values.flightRef` to `values.hotelRef`.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:38:16 PM - 12:39:01 PM:** A debugging phase involved temporarily commenting out and then re-enabling the `axiosTseInstance.post` call and related `exportHeader` import within `fetchAllData`.
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:06:44 PM:** The `ActionColumnTemplate` URL was corrected from `/admin/search-details-flight/` to `/admin/search-details-hotel/`, aligning it with hotel search details.
    *   **10/26/2025, 4:28:03 PM:** Extensive JSDoc-style comments were added to the component, detailing its purpose, features, props, and dependencies. Inline comments were also added for various sections.

    *   **10/26/2025, 12:19:47 PM:** Initial component for dynamically rendering hotel filter fields (date range, text inputs, company dropdown). It was observed that check-in/check-out date pickers were initially tied to `outboundDate`/`inboundDate` fields.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:23:04 PM:** A debugging `console.log` was added.
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:26:21 PM - 12:27:26 PM:** Logic for Check-in and Check-out Date Pickers was modified to correctly reference their respective `checkIn` and `checkOut` fields, and then reverted to use `outboundDate` and `inboundDate` fields from `filterInfo` in a subsequent commit, suggesting the constant `filterInfo` explicitly uses these names for hotel dates.
    *   **10/26/2025, 4:26:14 PM:** Comprehensive JSDoc and inline comments were added to the component.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchHotelList.js`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 12:46:11 PM:** Introduced `defaultSearchHotelList` constant with `list_config` for table columns and `filter_info` for filter fields (including `outboundDate` and `inboundDate` for hotel dates).
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:35:10 PM:** Added a new `update_info` object, providing detailed configurations (labels, field types, sample values) for various hotel search attributes, likely for a detail view.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\HotelDetails.jsx`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:06:26 PM:** This file started as a copy of a `FlightDetails` component, evidenced by its original name `FlightDetails` and API calls to `/getFlightDetailsById` and `fetchAirports`. It set up state for data display, geolocation, and user info.
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:12:35 PM:** The API endpoint in `fetchEditData` was correctly changed from `/getFlightDetailsById` to `/getHotelDetailsByID`, and the payload key from `flight_search_id` to `hotel_search_id`.
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:21:21 PM:** The `pageLoading` state was explicitly set to `false` upon successful API response.
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:21:56 PM:** A debugging `console.log` was added for "Flight Details Data".
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:41:48 PM:** The `editFieldInfo` was updated to use `defaultSearchHotelList?.update_info`, correctly referencing the hotel-specific constant.
    *   **10/26/2025, 3:06:17 PM:** Significant refactoring and documentation: extensive JSDoc comments were added, `FaPlane` (flight icon) was removed, and `fetchAirports` Redux action import was removed, which would cause an error for the `handleSearchAgain` function that still used it. The `useAuth` hook import was also removed, causing another error.
    *   **10/26/2025, 4:02:16 PM:** The component name was changed from `FlightDetails` to `HotelDetails`, and JSDoc `@module` and `@function` were updated.
    *   **10/26/2025, 4:03:14 PM:** Removed `useAuth` hook call and unused `follow`, `openFilter` states, fixing the import error.
    *   **10/26/2025, 4:05:07 PM:** `dispatch` (Redux), `fetchAirports`, and `supabase` imports were removed, along with the `userInfo` function, `userData` state, and the `handleSearchAgain` function. This significantly simplified the component, making it purely for display and geolocation, removing all business logic related to re-searching or Redux state management.
    *   **10/26/2025, 4:11:25 PM:** The `useNavigate` import and variable were also removed, further confirming the removal of all navigation-related functionality. Unused refs and states (`toast`, `hasToastShown`, `activeTab`, `btnLoading`) were cleaned up.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\constants.js`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:05:56 PM:** Detailed color palette definitions (`blue`, `indigo`, `green`, `red`, etc.) and text color definitions (`fiord`, `Slate Gray`, etc.) were present. This file contains various application-wide constants. Subsequent entries (3:46:46 PM, 4:31:15 PM, 4:33:18 PM) were re-saves with no functional changes.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetails.jsx`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:15:08 PM:** This file represents the dedicated `FlightDetails` component, correctly calling `/getFlightDetailsById` and using `defaultSearchFlightList`.
    *   **10/26/2025, 2:20:35 PM:** Similar to `HotelDetails.jsx`, `pageLoading` was explicitly set to `false` after API response.
    *   **10/26/2025, 3:27:59 PM - 3:28:22 PM:** Minor re-saves.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\SearchHistory.jsx`**
    *   **10/26/2025, 3:25:39 PM:** Initial component for managing search history with tab navigation (Flights, Hotel). It uses `useSearchParams` for URL synchronization. `useEffect` was not imported, causing a bug.
    *   **10/26/2025, 3:26:06 PM:** `useSearchParams` was explicitly imported.
    *   **10/26/2025, 3:26:19 PM:** `useEffect` was imported, fixing a previous error.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetailsPage.jsx`**

    *   **10/26/2025, 4:35:32 PM:** New file introduced as a stripped-down version of `SearchHistory.jsx`, which directly renders `FlightHistory` without the tab navigation or conditional rendering logic.
    *   **10/26/2025, 4:36:12 PM:** Renamed from `SearchHistory` to `BookingList`, and unused imports and state variables were removed, simplifying it to primarily render `FlightHistory`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Extensive Documentation (Post-3 PM):** A significant pattern involves adding detailed JSDoc comments to components, functions, and state variables across almost all modified files after 3:00 PM. This indicates a strong focus on improving code readability, maintainability, and understanding.
2.  **Component Refactoring and Relocation:** There's a clear effort to organize components, moving them from a `pages` directory to a `components` directory (e.g., `FlightDetails`, `HotelDetails`). This also involved renaming `FlightDetails` to `HotelDetails` in the context of hotel searches, and adapting it by changing API endpoints and constants. The introduction of `FlightDetailsPage` and `HotelDetailsPage` as wrapper components further supports this architectural change.
3.  **Dependency Simplification/Modularization:** In `HotelDetails.jsx` (both versions in `pages` and `components`), there's a progressive and consistent removal of Redux (`useDispatch`, `fetchAirports`), Supabase (`supabase`, user data fetching), and React Router's `useNavigate` functionality. This suggests an intentional design choice to make these "detail" components purely for data display from an API, delegating complex logic like re-searching or user lookups to other parts of the application or making them more generic. The geolocation `axios` call was also removed from the `components/HotelDetails.jsx`.
4.  **Formik for Filtering:** `useFormik` is consistently applied in both `HotelHistory` and `FlightHistory` for managing filter form states.
5.  **API Interaction:** `axiosTseInstance.post` is the primary method for fetching data from internal backend APIs, while `axios.get` to `https://ip-get-geolocation.com` is used for external IP geolocation.
6.  **URL Synchronization:** `useSearchParams` and `useEffect` are used in `SearchHistory.jsx` to synchronize active tabs with URL query parameters, enabling persistent navigation state.
7.  **Bug Fixing and Refinement:** Several minor bugs were addressed, such as correcting Formik variable names, updating payload keys, fixing action column URLs, and ensuring all necessary React hooks are imported.

The log entries primarily show a development cycle involving feature implementation (hotel history, hotel details), architectural refactoring (component relocation, wrapper pages), and a strong push for code documentation and cleanup by removing unused dependencies and states.
