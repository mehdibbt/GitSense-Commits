# Activity Summary for 10/27/2025

## 1:20:57 PM
The code changes primarily revolve around enhancing the display and styling of booking statuses within a CRM application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Interface\BookingList\BookingList.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup (10/27/2025, 12:24:50 PM):** Introduced the `BookingList` React component, which features state management, Formik-based filtering, API integration (`/filterBookingResources`), and a DataTable for displaying booking information. Key table columns include `id`, `createdAt`, `clientName`, and a placeholder `statusTemplate` that initially displayed origin details.
    *   **Adding Total Cost (10/27/2025, 12:27:48 PM):** Integrated a `priceFormattor` utility and added a `totalCostTemplate` to format and display the `totalCost` in the table, thereby enhancing financial clarity.
    *   **Status Template Evolution (10/27/2025, 12:31:15 PM & 12:34:34 PM):** The `statusTemplate` was significantly updated. Initially, it was changed to parse `itineraryItems` and `status` from JSON strings, with `console.log` statements added for debugging these parsed values. This marked the beginning of a more complex status display.
    *   **Advanced Status Rendering (10/27/2025, 12:46:13 PM & 12:47:31 PM):** The `statusTemplate` received a major overhaul. It now dynamically renders statuses for different service types (flight, hotel, transfer, activity) based on parsed `itineraryItems` and `status` data. A `config` object was introduced to map statuses to specific CSS class names, and a `renderStatus` helper function was added to generate formatted status paragraphs. The rendering was made conditional, only showing statuses for active service types.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\BookingList.js`**
    *   **Initial Definition (10/27/2025, 12:29:08 PM):** Defined `bookingListInfo` containing configurations for table columns (`list_config`), filter options (`filter_info`), and update information (`update_info`) relevant to booking resources.
    *   **Status Column Width Adjustment (10/27/2025, 12:47:50 PM):** The `columnWidth` for the "status" field in `list_config` was increased from `"6"` to `"12"`, providing more space for the newly complex status display in the UI.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\assets\modules\dashboard.css`**
    *   **Initial Styling (10/27/2025, 12:50:32 PM):** Defined core dashboard panel styles and, importantly, introduced specific color styles for various booking statuses: `status-confirmed` (green), `status-ticketed` (deep blue), `status-pending` (amber), `status-notbooked` (dark grey), `status-quote` (blue), and `status-cancelled` (red).

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\assets\modules\Common.css`**
    *   **Initial Status Styling (10/27/2025, 12:51:24 PM):** Included general UI styles, and notably, duplicated the same set of status color classes as found in `dashboard.css`.
    *   **New Status and Color Adjustments (10/27/2025, 12:52:41 PM - 1:02:46 PM):** This file saw frequent, iterative updates to status colors.
        *   `status-ticket-in-progress` was introduced (initially deep blue, later purple).
        *   `status-notbooked` changed from dark grey to orange, then to yellow.
        *   `status-quote` changed from blue to purple, then back to blue using Tailwind CSS classes.
        *   `status-pending` changed from amber to orange using Tailwind CSS.
        *   `status-ticketed` changed from deep blue to green using Tailwind CSS.
        *   There were also minor cleanups involving redundant class declarations during this period.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/27/2025, 12:27:48 PM:** `BookingList.jsx` updated to include `totalCost` formatting.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:31:15 PM:** `BookingList.jsx` began complex status parsing.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:46:13 PM:** `BookingList.jsx` finalized the dynamic, service-type-aware status rendering.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:47:50 PM:** `BookingList.js` adjusted the status column width in table configuration.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:50:32 PM:** `dashboard.css` introduced initial, distinct color styling for booking statuses.
*   **10/27/2025, 12:52:41 PM onwards:** `Common.css` underwent a series of rapid changes to refine and re-color various status classes, often transitioning from hex codes to Tailwind CSS `@apply` directives, indicating an active styling iteration phase.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The most prominent pattern is the **iterative enhancement of booking status display and styling**. The `BookingList.jsx` component became increasingly sophisticated in how it interprets and renders booking statuses, requiring corresponding and frequent updates to CSS files (`dashboard.css` and `Common.css`) to define and adjust the visual appearance (colors) of these statuses. There's a clear move towards using **Tailwind CSS classes** (`@apply text-orange-500`) for styling in the later CSS changes, suggesting an adoption or consolidation of styling practices. Multiple `console.log` statements in the `.jsx` file, especially during the `statusTemplate` overhaul, point to an **active debugging and development process**. There were also instances of seemingly redundant CSS declarations or minor refactors in `Common.css`, indicating rapid iteration and cleanup.
