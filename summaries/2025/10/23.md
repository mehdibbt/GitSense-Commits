# Activity Summary for 10/23/2025

## 1:23:06 PM
The `FlightDetails.jsx` file underwent several iterations of changes between 10/23/2025, 12:28:10 PM and 1:06:26 PM, primarily focusing on data fetching and UI responsiveness.
*   **Geolocation Logic Refinements (12:29 PM - 12:32 PM):**
    *   Initially (12:29:20 PM), an attempt was made to change the geolocation API endpoint in `fetchLocation` from `/json` to `/jsons`, which was later reverted (12:32:16 PM), suggesting a quick fix or typo correction.
    *   An `else` block was added (12:30:03 PM) to `fetchLocation` to display the raw IP if geolocation fails, which included a minor typo (`ip_addres`) that was corrected shortly after (12:32:05 PM).
    *   Debugging `console.log` statements were added (12:30:37 PM) and subsequently removed (12:32:39 PM) from the `fetchLocation` function.
*   **"Search Again" Functionality Evolution (12:50 PM - 1:06 PM):**
    *   Initially (12:50:00 PM), debugging `console.log` statements were added, and the navigation logic after fetching airports was commented out.
    *   A significant, but problematic, change occurred (12:56:56 PM) where the `handleSearchAgain` function was refactored to use a direct `fetch` API call, copying logic (including undefined variables like `controller`, `setFilteredAirports`, `setSearchLoading`) from `ComboSearchInput.jsx`, which would have caused runtime errors.
    *   This problematic direct `fetch` implementation was then slightly adjusted (12:57:45 PM by defining `searchParam`) and again (12:58:08 PM by removing the problematic `signal` parameter), before being completely reverted (1:01:12 PM). The original Redux `dispatch(fetchAirports)` call was reinstated, restoring the more robust Redux pattern.
    *   Finally (1:06:20 PM), the navigation logic within `handleSearchAgain` was re-enabled. A critical update involved transforming the `airportsData` payload received from `fetchAirports` into a structured object (`cityName`, `codeIataAirport`, `nameAirport`) to ensure data consistency before being passed via navigation state.

The `FlightContent.jsx` file, a component for flight search input, remained stable across the provided timestamps (12:35:53 PM - 1:08:07 PM). It consistently managed state for various search parameters (journey type, dates, airports, passenger counts, cabin class), performed client-side validation, and constructed API payloads (`searchAirLegs`, `searchParam`), saving the search data to `sessionStorage`. No functional code changes were observed in the provided snippets for this file.

The `ComboSearchInput.jsx` file saw a significant update at 10/23/2025, 12:53:53 PM.
*   **Search Input Performance Enhancement (12:53 PM):** The `search` function was fundamentally refactored to improve user experience and API efficiency. It introduced **debouncing** with a 300ms delay to limit API calls during rapid typing and integrated an **`AbortController`** to cancel previous in-flight requests when a new search term is entered. The minimum input length for triggering a search was increased to two characters, and error handling was refined to specifically ignore expected `AbortError`s.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Debugging:** Frequent use and subsequent removal of `console.log` statements across `FlightDetails.jsx`, indicating active development and troubleshooting.
*   **State Management:** Consistent utilization of React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for local component state and side effects.
*   **API Interaction:** Regular use of `axios` and `fetch` with `exportHeader` for data retrieval.
*   **Redux Integration:** `FlightDetails.jsx` and `FlightContent.jsx` both interact with Redux, dispatching `fetchAirports` actions and managing application state.
*   **Form Validation:** `FlightContent.jsx` shows a robust pattern of validating user inputs (airports, dates, passenger counts, child ages) before initiating a search.
*   **UI/UX Focus:** Improvements like collapsing/expanding sections in `FlightDetails.jsx` and the advanced debouncing/aborting logic in `ComboSearchInput.jsx` highlight a focus on user interface and experience.
*   **Refactoring and Reversion:** The repeated changes and subsequent reversion in `FlightDetails.jsx`'s `handleSearchAgain` illustrate an exploratory development process, testing different implementation approaches before settling on an appropriate one.
