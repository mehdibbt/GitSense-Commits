# Activity Summary for 10/22/2025

## 1:31:10 PM
The changes primarily focus on two files related to flight search and details: `FlightDetails.jsx` and `FlightContent.jsx`, all occurring on 10/22/2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchDetails\FlightDetails.jsx`**
    *   **UI/Navigation Refinement (10/22/2025, 12:36:27 PM - 1:05:56 PM):**
        *   The "Search Again" link's text was updated from "Back" to "Search Again" (12:36:27 PM).
        *   The order of the "Refresh" button and "Search Again" link in the header was swapped (12:36:39 PM).
        *   The "Search Again" link's destination was changed to the general search page (`/admin/search`) and it started passing the current flight details (`data`) as state (`searchRequest: data`) for re-use (12:46:07 PM).
        *   The state passed to the "Search Again" link was made more robust to handle potentially empty `data` by using `data || []` (12:47:19 PM).
        *   Conditional rendering was introduced for the "Search Again" button, making it visible only for non-MultiCity flights with an outbound date that is in the future (1:05:56 PM).
    *   **Transient Data Display Change (10/22/2025, 1:09:24 PM - 1:09:37 PM):**
        *   The input field for `transactionId` was temporarily modified to display an empty string (`value={''}`) (1:09:24 PM), suggesting a quick test or accidental change.
        *   This change was almost immediately reverted, restoring the display of `data?.transactionId ?? ''` (1:09:37 PM), indicating the previous behavior was desired.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\Backend\Search\Flight\FlightContent\FlightContent.jsx`**
    *   **Debugging Addition (10/22/2025, 12:53:40 PM):**
        *   A `console.log("searchParam", searchParam);` statement was added within the `submitForm` function. This indicates a debugging step to inspect the final search parameters before they are stored in `sessionStorage` and dispatched.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/22/2025, 12:36:27 PM:** "Search Again" link text update.
*   **10/22/2025, 12:46:07 PM:** "Search Again" link navigation and state passing logic updated.

*   **10/22/2025, 1:09:24 PM - 1:09:37 PM:** Brief and reverted change to `transactionId` display.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **UI/UX Refinement:** The `FlightDetails.jsx` file shows a clear pattern of iterative improvements to the user interface, specifically concerning the "Search Again" functionality, including text, placement, navigation, data transfer, and conditional visibility.
*   **Debugging:** The addition of `console.log` statements in `FlightContent.jsx` is a common pattern for developers to inspect data flow and verify logic during development or troubleshooting.
*   **Focused Development Session:** All changes are clustered on the same day, indicating a concentrated effort on these specific components and functionalities.
