# Activity Summary for 10/12/2025

## 12:15:53 PM
The code changes log indicates significant development activity across several frontend files within a Supabase CRM project, primarily focusing on data listing, filtering, and editing functionalities, along with the introduction of tabbed interfaces.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\SearchHistory.jsx`

This file underwent rapid and iterative changes, indicating active development on a "Search History" interface.

*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:01 AM:** Initial setup of the `SearchHistory` React component. It includes state management for filtering, table data, and total count. A `useFormik` instance (`filterData`) is defined with initial values for various date ranges and task-related filters. The component displays UI elements for filtering, refreshing, column settings, data export, and creating new tasks, along with a `DataTableList` for displaying results. The `fetchAllData` function is called but relies on an unimported utility.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:30 AM:** The `fetchListAllData` utility function is imported from `../../../../util/utilityFunction`, resolving a dependency for data fetching.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:58 AM:** A new constant `exCludeColumn` is introduced and set to `'user_task'`, which is then passed to the `fetchListAllData` call.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:31:32 AM:** Several new state variables are added and reordered: `page`, `row`, `exportData`, `tableHeader`, `createInfo`, `filterInfo`, and `activeStatus`, indicating an expansion of the component's state management for pagination, export data, and UI configuration.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:04:06 PM:**
    *   The `axiosTseInstance` is imported, suggesting a switch in the data fetching mechanism.
    *   The previous `fetchListAllData` import is removed.
    *   The `HandleSetApiResponse` function signature is simplified, removing direct parameters, implying data handling logic might shift.
    *   The `fetchAllData` function is completely refactored to use `axiosTseInstance.post('/fareRules', flightRulesDetails, { headers: exportHeader })`. This change appears to be in progress or erroneous as `fetchAllData` is declared twice, and the `await` keyword is used outside an `async` context for the second declaration.
    *   Significant parts of the UI, including `ExportDataTable`, the "Create" link, and `DataTableList`, are commented out.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:04:15 PM:** The first, commented-out declaration of `fetchAllData` is removed, leaving only the `axiosTseInstance.post` version. The import for `fetchListAllData` is also explicitly removed.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:06:12 PM:** The `fetchAllData` declaration is further adjusted to be an assignment (not `await`) and `flightRulesDetails` is commented out, resulting in `axiosTseInstance.post('/fareRules', { headers: exportHeader } );`. A duplicate `activeStatus` state declaration is commented out.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:14:16 PM:**
    *   A new state variable `activeTab` is added and initialized to `"tab11"`.
    *   A `tabs` array is introduced, defining navigation for different search categories: `Flights`, `Hotel`, `Transfer`, and `Attraction`, each with an ID, name, and icon.
    *   JSX for rendering these new tabs is added, allowing users to switch between search types, and corresponding `div` elements are included to display placeholder content for each tab.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:14:49 PM:** React icon imports (`HiMiniBuildingOffice`, `IoFolder`) are added to support the icons used in the newly introduced tab navigation.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:15:07 PM:** The `exportHeader` constant is imported from `../../../../constants/headers`, which is now being used in the `axiosTseInstance.post` call for `fetchAllData`.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:15:17 PM:** The `useEffect` hook that triggered data fetching (`fetchAllData()` and `fetchExportData()`) is commented out, effectively disabling immediate data loading. The `axiosTseInstance.post` definition for `fetchAllData` is also commented out. The `useEffect` import is removed since it's no longer actively used.

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`

*   **10/12/2025, 11:43:07 AM:** This new file defines constants for search and task management. It exports `taskConstant` with `taskStatus` and `taskPriority` options. It also exports `defaultSearchFlightList`, a detailed configuration object for a list display (`list_config` with columns like `id`, `Reference`, `Origin`, `Outbound`, `Destination`, `Inbound`, `updated_at`, `items`) and a create form (`create_info` with fields like `task_subject`, `task_status`, `folder_id`, `task_priority`, `client_id`, `assign_by`, `start_date`, `start_time`, `due_date`, `due_time`, `task_message_body`). Notably, 'Reference' appears twice in the `list_config`.

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Company\CompanyEdit.jsx`

This file manages the editing interface for company details.

*   **10/12/2025, 12:09:23 PM:** The `CompanyEdit` React component is set up, utilizing `formik` for form handling, `supabase` for data interaction, and `react-router-dom` for navigation. It fetches and displays company data for editing, including fields like `company_name`, `company_no`, `trading_as`, `com_status`, `company_logo`, and `is_corporate`. The component includes a header with refresh, JSON export, and back navigation. It also defines a comprehensive list of tabs (`Folder`, `Client Folder`, `Contact`, `Credit`, `Email`, `Bank`, `Customer Note`, `Address`, `Email Api`, `Api`, `Other`, `TSE`, `SMA`, `Integration`, `History`) for organizing company-related information, though most tab content is initially commented out. A modal for JSON code display is also present.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:09:32 PM:** New tab-specific components (`AddressTab`, `BankTab`, `HistoryTab`, `OthersTab`) are imported. The component then updates its JSX to conditionally render these new tab components within the `tab-content` section for their respective tabs (`BankTab` for `tab6`, `AddressTab` for `tab8`, `OthersTab` for `tab11`), indicating a modular approach to tab content implementation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Both `SearchHistory` and `CompanyEdit` are implemented as React functional components, showcasing a modular approach to UI development.
*   **Form Management with Formik:** `formik` is consistently used across different pages (`SearchHistory`, `CompanyEdit`) for efficient form state management, validation, and submission.
*   **Dynamic UI and State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` hooks for managing local component state (e.g., filtering status, page numbers, active tabs, data arrays, loading indicators).
*   **Tabbed Interfaces for Organization:** Both `SearchHistory` and `CompanyEdit` adopt a tab-based navigation pattern to categorize and display different types of information or functionalities within a single page, improving user experience for complex interfaces.
*   **Data Fetching and API Interaction:** Evolution in `SearchHistory.jsx` from a custom `fetchListAllData` utility to `axiosTseInstance` for API calls, indicating a potential standardization or refactoring of network requests. `CompanyEdit.jsx` uses both a utility function for initial data and `supabase` directly for updates.
*   **UI Tooling:** Consistent use of `primereact/Toast` for notifications and `flowbite-react/Tooltip` for enhanced button functionality. `Pageheader` is a recurring UI component for page titles and navigation.
*   **Administrative/CRM Context:** The file paths and content (`backend`, `Interface`, `Company`, `tasks`, `companies`) strongly suggest these changes are part of a larger CRM or administrative application, dealing with client management, task tracking, and search functionalities.
*   **Iterative Development:** The rapid succession of timestamps for `SearchHistory.jsx` indicates an agile and iterative development process on specific features, with frequent commits or saves reflecting incremental progress and refactoring.
