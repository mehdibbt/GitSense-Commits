# Activity Summary for 10/12/2025

## 12:15:53 PM
The code changes log indicates significant development activity across several frontend files within a Supabase CRM project, primarily focusing on data listing, filtering, and editing functionalities, along with the introduction of tabbed interfaces.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\SearchHistory.jsx`

This file underwent rapid and iterative changes, indicating active development on a "Search History" interface.

*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:01 AM:** Initial setup of the `SearchHistory` React component. It includes state management for filtering, table data, and total count. A `useFormik` instance (`filterData`) is defined with initial values for various date ranges and task-related filters. The component displays UI elements for filtering, refreshing, column settings, data export, and creating new tasks, along with a `DataTableList` for displaying results. The `fetchAllData` function is called but relies on an unimported utility.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:30 AM:** The `fetchListAllData` utility function is imported from `../../../../util/utilityFunction`, resolving a dependency for data fetching.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:58 AM:** A new constant `exCludeColumn` is introduced and set to `'user_task'`, which is then passed to the `fetchListAllData` call.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:31:32 AM:** Several new state variables are added and reordered: `page`, `row`, `exportData`, `tableHeader`, `createInfo`, `filterInfo`, and `activeStatus`, indicating an expansion of the component's state management for pagination, export data, and UI configuration.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:04:06 PM:**
    *   The `axiosTseInstance` is imported, suggesting a switch in the data fetching mechanism.
    *   The previous `fetchListAllData` import is removed.
    *   The `HandleSetApiResponse` function signature is simplified, removing direct parameters, implying data handling logic might shift.
    *   The `fetchAllData` function is completely refactored to use `axiosTseInstance.post('/fareRules', flightRulesDetails, { headers: exportHeader })`. This change appears to be in progress or erroneous as `fetchAllData` is declared twice, and the `await` keyword is used outside an `async` context for the second declaration.
    *   Significant parts of the UI, including `ExportDataTable`, the "Create" link, and `DataTableList`, are commented out.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:04:15 PM:** The first, commented-out declaration of `fetchAllData` is removed, leaving only the `axiosTseInstance.post` version. The import for `fetchListAllData` is also explicitly removed.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:06:12 PM:** The `fetchAllData` declaration is further adjusted to be an assignment (not `await`) and `flightRulesDetails` is commented out, resulting in `axiosTseInstance.post('/fareRules', { headers: exportHeader } );`. A duplicate `activeStatus` state declaration is commented out.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:14:16 PM:**
    *   A new state variable `activeTab` is added and initialized to `"tab11"`.
    *   A `tabs` array is introduced, defining navigation for different search categories: `Flights`, `Hotel`, `Transfer`, and `Attraction`, each with an ID, name, and icon.
    *   JSX for rendering these new tabs is added, allowing users to switch between search types, and corresponding `div` elements are included to display placeholder content for each tab.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:14:49 PM:** React icon imports (`HiMiniBuildingOffice`, `IoFolder`) are added to support the icons used in the newly introduced tab navigation.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:15:07 PM:** The `exportHeader` constant is imported from `../../../../constants/headers`, which is now being used in the `axiosTseInstance.post` call for `fetchAllData`.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:15:17 PM:** The `useEffect` hook that triggered data fetching (`fetchAllData()` and `fetchExportData()`) is commented out, effectively disabling immediate data loading. The `axiosTseInstance.post` definition for `fetchAllData` is also commented out. The `useEffect` import is removed since it's no longer actively used.

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`

*   **10/12/2025, 11:43:07 AM:** This new file defines constants for search and task management. It exports `taskConstant` with `taskStatus` and `taskPriority` options. It also exports `defaultSearchFlightList`, a detailed configuration object for a list display (`list_config` with columns like `id`, `Reference`, `Origin`, `Outbound`, `Destination`, `Inbound`, `updated_at`, `items`) and a create form (`create_info` with fields like `task_subject`, `task_status`, `folder_id`, `task_priority`, `client_id`, `assign_by`, `start_date`, `start_time`, `due_date`, `due_time`, `task_message_body`). Notably, 'Reference' appears twice in the `list_config`.

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Company\CompanyEdit.jsx`

This file manages the editing interface for company details.

*   **10/12/2025, 12:09:23 PM:** The `CompanyEdit` React component is set up, utilizing `formik` for form handling, `supabase` for data interaction, and `react-router-dom` for navigation. It fetches and displays company data for editing, including fields like `company_name`, `company_no`, `trading_as`, `com_status`, `company_logo`, and `is_corporate`. The component includes a header with refresh, JSON export, and back navigation. It also defines a comprehensive list of tabs (`Folder`, `Client Folder`, `Contact`, `Credit`, `Email`, `Bank`, `Customer Note`, `Address`, `Email Api`, `Api`, `Other`, `TSE`, `SMA`, `Integration`, `History`) for organizing company-related information, though most tab content is initially commented out. A modal for JSON code display is also present.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:09:32 PM:** New tab-specific components (`AddressTab`, `BankTab`, `HistoryTab`, `OthersTab`) are imported. The component then updates its JSX to conditionally render these new tab components within the `tab-content` section for their respective tabs (`BankTab` for `tab6`, `AddressTab` for `tab8`, `OthersTab` for `tab11`), indicating a modular approach to tab content implementation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Both `SearchHistory` and `CompanyEdit` are implemented as React functional components, showcasing a modular approach to UI development.
*   **Form Management with Formik:** `formik` is consistently used across different pages (`SearchHistory`, `CompanyEdit`) for efficient form state management, validation, and submission.
*   **Dynamic UI and State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` hooks for managing local component state (e.g., filtering status, page numbers, active tabs, data arrays, loading indicators).
*   **Tabbed Interfaces for Organization:** Both `SearchHistory` and `CompanyEdit` adopt a tab-based navigation pattern to categorize and display different types of information or functionalities within a single page, improving user experience for complex interfaces.
*   **Data Fetching and API Interaction:** Evolution in `SearchHistory.jsx` from a custom `fetchListAllData` utility to `axiosTseInstance` for API calls, indicating a potential standardization or refactoring of network requests. `CompanyEdit.jsx` uses both a utility function for initial data and `supabase` directly for updates.
*   **UI Tooling:** Consistent use of `primereact/Toast` for notifications and `flowbite-react/Tooltip` for enhanced button functionality. `Pageheader` is a recurring UI component for page titles and navigation.
*   **Administrative/CRM Context:** The file paths and content (`backend`, `Interface`, `Company`, `tasks`, `companies`) strongly suggest these changes are part of a larger CRM or administrative application, dealing with client management, task tracking, and search functionalities.
*   **Iterative Development:** The rapid succession of timestamps for `SearchHistory.jsx` indicates an agile and iterative development process on specific features, with frequent commits or saves reflecting incremental progress and refactoring.

## 2:39:53 PM
The development log details a refactoring and implementation effort for a "Search History" feature, primarily focusing on displaying flight search records.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\SearchHistory.jsx`**
    *   **10/12/2025, 12:16:09 PM**: Initial creation of the `SearchHistory` component. It includes state for filtering, pagination, table data, and an `activeTab` with predefined tabs ("flight", "hotel", "transfer", "attraction"). A `useFormik` instance `filterData` is set up with initial values for task-related filtering, though much of the UI and data fetching logic is commented out. The component primarily renders a `Pageheader` and tab navigation.
    *   **10/12/2025, 12:20:27 PM - 12:20:47 PM**: Minor UI adjustments, including importing and uncommenting a `ButtonFilter` and `DateRangeWirhoutCalender` component for filter controls, then re-commenting a refresh button.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:45:25 PM**: Underwent a significant refactor. Most of the state variables (related to filtering, pagination, table data) and form logic (`filterData`, `HandleSetApiResponse`, `fetchAllData`, `clearFilter`) were removed. The component was streamlined to act primarily as a tab container, delegating the content rendering for the "flight" tab to a newly imported `FlightHistory` component.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:46:46 PM**: Explicitly passed `authLoading`, `token`, `user`, and `hasPermission` props to the `FlightHistory` child component.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**
    *   **10/12/2025, 12:23:35 PM**: Initially created as a placeholder component rendering "FlightHistory".
    *   **10/12/2025, 12:25:08 PM**: Expanded to include the state management, `useFormik` filter setup (with task-related initial values), and placeholder API/response handling (`HandleSetApiResponse`, commented-out `fetchAllData`) that was previously in `SearchHistory.jsx`. It also includes basic filter UI components.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:42:47 PM**: `filterData.initialValues` were updated to be flight-specific (e.g., `origin`, `destination`, `outboundDate`). The `fetchAllData` function was uncommented and updated to make a POST request to `/flightSearchResources`, marking the start of actual data fetching implementation.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:45:44 PM - 1:46:19 PM**: Refactored to receive user/auth context via props instead of `useContextAuth`. Imports for `useFormik`, `useState`, `ButtonFilter`, and `DateRangeWirhoutCalender` were added to this file.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:47:45 PM**: The `company` field in `filterData.initialValues` was set to dynamically use `user?.company_id` and `user?.company_uid`.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:48:19 PM - 1:48:49 PM**: The `useEffect` hook was activated to trigger `fetchAllData` upon authentication changes. Imports for `useEffect`, `axiosTseInstance`, and `exportHeader` were added. `fetchAllData` logic was refined to handle dynamic payloads based on form values. A typo in a `console.log` was fixed.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:56:34 PM - 1:58:32 PM**: The `fetchAllData` function was significantly enhanced to build a conditional payload (`defaultPayload` or `formikPayload`) based on whether formik values should be used. This involved converting payload from an array to an object and refining how `filterData.values` are accessed.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:59:57 PM - 2:00:40 PM**: Corrected the `axiosTseInstance.post` call to pass the `payload` directly as the request body and added `await` to the API call for proper asynchronous handling.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:01:50 PM - 2:02:46 PM**: `HandleSetApiResponse` was updated to receive and process `listData` (likely the API response), specifically setting the `tableData` state. Other functionalities within `HandleSetApiResponse` were commented out.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:09:18 PM**: Imports for `DataTableList` and `defaultSearchFlightList` (a constant for table configuration) were added. `HandleSetApiResponse` was updated to set `tableHeader` using `defaultSearchFlightList?.list_config`. The `DataTableList` component was uncommented in the JSX, though most of its props remained commented.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:17:19 PM - 2:17:42 PM**: Introduced `useMemo` and `generateTableColumns` for dynamic table column generation based on `tableHeader`. Custom template functions (`outboundTemplate`, `inboundTemplate`, `updatedDateTemplate`) were defined for specific column rendering, and `formatDate` was imported.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:19:21 PM - 2:19:39 PM**: Imported `ActionColumnTemplate` and defined an `actionColumn` function for table rows, integrating it into `generateTableColumns`.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:20:58 PM - 2:21:15 PM**: Added a `loading` state and integrated it with `DataTableList` and `HandleSetApiResponse`.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:22:47 PM**: Explicitly imported `formatDate` for use in column templates.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:30:44 PM - 2:31:32 PM**: Added `originTemplate`, `destinationTemplate`, and `itemTemplate` functions for more detailed column rendering, further customizing the table display and integrating them into `generateTableColumns`. The `paginator` prop for `DataTableList` was uncommented and set to `true`.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\UI\DataTable\DataTableList.jsx`**
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:21:38 PM**: This file was introduced (or heavily updated) to provide a generic `DataTableList` component. It acts as a wrapper for PrimeReact's `DataTable` and `Paginator`. It includes prop types, state for pagination, functions for page changes, and utilities for stripping HTML tags from content. It dynamically renders columns based on `tableColumn` prop, supports indexing, and displays `Loader` or `EmptyData` based on `loading` and data presence.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`**
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:28:45 PM**: This new file defines configuration constants. `defaultSearchFlightList` contains `list_config` which specifies the default column headers and properties (field name, label, sortable, width, etc.) for the flight search history table. It also includes `create_info` for task-related form fields, though these are not directly used in the flight history display.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Component Modularity**: A clear pattern of refactoring the `SearchHistory` component to be a tab container and delegating specific tab logic (e.g., `FlightHistory`) to dedicated child components. This promotes a cleaner separation of concerns.
2.  **State Management**: Consistent use of React's `useState` hook for managing local component state (loading, filtering, pagination) and `useFormik` for robust form handling and validation.
3.  **Data Fetching**: Repeated pattern of using `useEffect` to trigger data fetching (`fetchAllData`) when authentication status (`authLoading`, `token`) changes. API calls are made via `axiosTseInstance.post` to a specific endpoint (`/flightSearchResources`) with dynamic payloads and headers.
4.  **Dynamic Table Rendering**: The application employs a configurable approach to render data tables. This involves:
    *   Defining column configurations in a separate constant (`defaultSearchFlightList`).
    *   Using a `generateTableColumns` utility function to create the actual `primereact` `Column` components.
    *   Leveraging `useMemo` to optimize table column generation.
    *   Implementing custom template functions (e.g., `outboundTemplate`, `originTemplate`) to format specific column data, ensuring flexibility in display.
5.  **UI Components**: Consistent use of reusable UI components such as `Pageheader`, `ButtonFilter`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`, `DataTableList` (a custom wrapper for PrimeReact), `ActionColumnTemplate`, `Loader`, and `EmptyData`.
6.  **Progressive Implementation**: The logs show a step-by-step implementation, where functionalities (like `useEffect` for data fetching, specific column templates, loading states) are initially commented out or basic, then gradually uncommented, refined, and made functional.
7.  **Console Logging**: Frequent use of `console.log` for debugging, especially during API call setup and prop passing.

## 3:39:25 PM
The log details a series of focused changes made on 10/12/2025, specifically between 3:15 PM and 3:38 PM, targeting a flight search and history feature within a Supabase CRM application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:15:34 PM:** This file was initially defined, exporting `taskConstant` (with task statuses and priorities) and `defaultSearchFlightList`. The `defaultSearchFlightList` object provides a `list_config` for displaying flight data (e.g., `id`, `flightRef`, `originFull`, `outboundDate`, `destinationFull`, `inboundDate`, `createdAt`, `items`) and `filter_info` for search criteria (e.g., `origin`, `destination`, `filterStartDate`, `filterEndDate`, `inboundDate`, `outboundDate`, `flightRef`).
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:16:04 PM:** A new filter field, `"company"`, was added to the `filter_info` within `defaultSearchFlightList`, expanding the filtering capabilities to include company-specific searches.

2.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:16:33 PM:** This is the initial entry for the `FlightHistory` React component. It imports `defaultSearchFlightList` and implements state management for table data, pagination, and filtering. It defines helper functions for date and location formatting, sets up `formik` for filter form handling, and includes an `useEffect` hook to fetch data. The component renders a `DataTableList` and a `FilterModal`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:21:40 PM:** A new `openFilter` state was added to control the visibility of the filter modal. Notably, the `FilterModal` component in the JSX was temporarily commented out.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:22:51 PM:** The `FilterModal` component in the JSX was uncommented, restoring its functionality.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:23:06 PM:** An explicit import for `FilterModal` from its component path was added.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:23:30 PM:** A `btnLoading` state was introduced, likely to manage loading indicators during filter submission.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:23:42 PM:** An explicit import for `TaskFilterBody` was added, which is used as the content for the `FilterModal`, resolving a dependency.

3.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightFilterBody.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:35:35 PM:** This file provides the filter interface for flight history. It dynamically renders input fields based on `filterInfo`, including a date range picker for "Created Date", text inputs for "Reference" and "Origin", an Ant Design `DatePicker` for "Outbound Date", and `FilterDropDown` components for "Destination", "Created By", and "Updated By" (utilizing user data from `useFetchComUser`).
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:38:26 PM:** Minor refinements were made to input fields: the `name` attributes for `flightRef` and `origin` were updated to dynamically use `filterInfo?.field`. More significantly, the `destination` input was changed from a `FilterDropDown` (which used `comUser`) to a standard `input type="text"`, and a new `inboundDate` filter, using an Ant Design `DatePicker`, was introduced.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configuration-Driven Development:** The `SearchFlightList.js` file serves as a central configuration for the data table columns and filter options, which are then consumed by the `FlightHistory.jsx` and `FlightFilterBody.jsx` components. This promotes consistency and ease of modification for the interface.
*   **Rapid Iteration on UI Components:** The timestamps show a quick succession of changes to `FlightHistory.jsx` (within ~7 minutes), indicating active development and refinement of the filtering mechanism and its associated modal. The temporary commenting out and subsequent uncommenting of the `FilterModal` highlight this iterative process.
*   **Standardized Form Handling:** The `useFormik` hook is consistently used across components for managing form state, initial values, and submission logic.
*   **Modular UI Components:** The project utilizes a `components/UI` directory for reusable UI elements like `ButtonFilter`, `DataTableList`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`, `FilterModal`, and `FilterDropDown`.
*   **Date Handling:** Both custom `DateRangeWirhoutCalender` and Ant Design's `DatePicker` (integrated with `dayjs`) are used for date selection, alongside a `formatDate` utility for consistent display.
*   **Dynamic Field Rendering:** `FlightFilterBody.jsx` demonstrates dynamic rendering of filter inputs based on the `filterInfo` configuration, allowing the UI to adapt to different filter requirements.
