# Activity Summary for 10/12/2025

## 12:15:53 PM
The code changes log indicates significant development activity across several frontend files within a Supabase CRM project, primarily focusing on data listing, filtering, and editing functionalities, along with the introduction of tabbed interfaces.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\SearchHistory.jsx`

This file underwent rapid and iterative changes, indicating active development on a "Search History" interface.

*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:01 AM:** Initial setup of the `SearchHistory` React component. It includes state management for filtering, table data, and total count. A `useFormik` instance (`filterData`) is defined with initial values for various date ranges and task-related filters. The component displays UI elements for filtering, refreshing, column settings, data export, and creating new tasks, along with a `DataTableList` for displaying results. The `fetchAllData` function is called but relies on an unimported utility.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:30 AM:** The `fetchListAllData` utility function is imported from `../../../../util/utilityFunction`, resolving a dependency for data fetching.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:30:58 AM:** A new constant `exCludeColumn` is introduced and set to `'user_task'`, which is then passed to the `fetchListAllData` call.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:31:32 AM:** Several new state variables are added and reordered: `page`, `row`, `exportData`, `tableHeader`, `createInfo`, `filterInfo`, and `activeStatus`, indicating an expansion of the component's state management for pagination, export data, and UI configuration.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:04:06 PM:**
    *   The `axiosTseInstance` is imported, suggesting a switch in the data fetching mechanism.
    *   The previous `fetchListAllData` import is removed.
    *   The `HandleSetApiResponse` function signature is simplified, removing direct parameters, implying data handling logic might shift.
    *   The `fetchAllData` function is completely refactored to use `axiosTseInstance.post('/fareRules', flightRulesDetails, { headers: exportHeader })`. This change appears to be in progress or erroneous as `fetchAllData` is declared twice, and the `await` keyword is used outside an `async` context for the second declaration.
    *   Significant parts of the UI, including `ExportDataTable`, the "Create" link, and `DataTableList`, are commented out.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:04:15 PM:** The first, commented-out declaration of `fetchAllData` is removed, leaving only the `axiosTseInstance.post` version. The import for `fetchListAllData` is also explicitly removed.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:06:12 PM:** The `fetchAllData` declaration is further adjusted to be an assignment (not `await`) and `flightRulesDetails` is commented out, resulting in `axiosTseInstance.post('/fareRules', { headers: exportHeader } );`. A duplicate `activeStatus` state declaration is commented out.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:14:16 PM:**
    *   A new state variable `activeTab` is added and initialized to `"tab11"`.
    *   A `tabs` array is introduced, defining navigation for different search categories: `Flights`, `Hotel`, `Transfer`, and `Attraction`, each with an ID, name, and icon.
    *   JSX for rendering these new tabs is added, allowing users to switch between search types, and corresponding `div` elements are included to display placeholder content for each tab.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:14:49 PM:** React icon imports (`HiMiniBuildingOffice`, `IoFolder`) are added to support the icons used in the newly introduced tab navigation.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:15:07 PM:** The `exportHeader` constant is imported from `../../../../constants/headers`, which is now being used in the `axiosTseInstance.post` call for `fetchAllData`.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:15:17 PM:** The `useEffect` hook that triggered data fetching (`fetchAllData()` and `fetchExportData()`) is commented out, effectively disabling immediate data loading. The `axiosTseInstance.post` definition for `fetchAllData` is also commented out. The `useEffect` import is removed since it's no longer actively used.

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`

*   **10/12/2025, 11:43:07 AM:** This new file defines constants for search and task management. It exports `taskConstant` with `taskStatus` and `taskPriority` options. It also exports `defaultSearchFlightList`, a detailed configuration object for a list display (`list_config` with columns like `id`, `Reference`, `Origin`, `Outbound`, `Destination`, `Inbound`, `updated_at`, `items`) and a create form (`create_info` with fields like `task_subject`, `task_status`, `folder_id`, `task_priority`, `client_id`, `assign_by`, `start_date`, `start_time`, `due_date`, `due_time`, `task_message_body`). Notably, 'Reference' appears twice in the `list_config`.

#### `h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Company\CompanyEdit.jsx`

This file manages the editing interface for company details.

*   **10/12/2025, 12:09:23 PM:** The `CompanyEdit` React component is set up, utilizing `formik` for form handling, `supabase` for data interaction, and `react-router-dom` for navigation. It fetches and displays company data for editing, including fields like `company_name`, `company_no`, `trading_as`, `com_status`, `company_logo`, and `is_corporate`. The component includes a header with refresh, JSON export, and back navigation. It also defines a comprehensive list of tabs (`Folder`, `Client Folder`, `Contact`, `Credit`, `Email`, `Bank`, `Customer Note`, `Address`, `Email Api`, `Api`, `Other`, `TSE`, `SMA`, `Integration`, `History`) for organizing company-related information, though most tab content is initially commented out. A modal for JSON code display is also present.
*   **10/12/2025, 12:09:32 PM:** New tab-specific components (`AddressTab`, `BankTab`, `HistoryTab`, `OthersTab`) are imported. The component then updates its JSX to conditionally render these new tab components within the `tab-content` section for their respective tabs (`BankTab` for `tab6`, `AddressTab` for `tab8`, `OthersTab` for `tab11`), indicating a modular approach to tab content implementation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Both `SearchHistory` and `CompanyEdit` are implemented as React functional components, showcasing a modular approach to UI development.
*   **Form Management with Formik:** `formik` is consistently used across different pages (`SearchHistory`, `CompanyEdit`) for efficient form state management, validation, and submission.
*   **Dynamic UI and State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` hooks for managing local component state (e.g., filtering status, page numbers, active tabs, data arrays, loading indicators).
*   **Tabbed Interfaces for Organization:** Both `SearchHistory` and `CompanyEdit` adopt a tab-based navigation pattern to categorize and display different types of information or functionalities within a single page, improving user experience for complex interfaces.
*   **Data Fetching and API Interaction:** Evolution in `SearchHistory.jsx` from a custom `fetchListAllData` utility to `axiosTseInstance` for API calls, indicating a potential standardization or refactoring of network requests. `CompanyEdit.jsx` uses both a utility function for initial data and `supabase` directly for updates.
*   **UI Tooling:** Consistent use of `primereact/Toast` for notifications and `flowbite-react/Tooltip` for enhanced button functionality. `Pageheader` is a recurring UI component for page titles and navigation.
*   **Administrative/CRM Context:** The file paths and content (`backend`, `Interface`, `Company`, `tasks`, `companies`) strongly suggest these changes are part of a larger CRM or administrative application, dealing with client management, task tracking, and search functionalities.
*   **Iterative Development:** The rapid succession of timestamps for `SearchHistory.jsx` indicates an agile and iterative development process on specific features, with frequent commits or saves reflecting incremental progress and refactoring.

## 2:39:53 PM
The development log details a refactoring and implementation effort for a "Search History" feature, primarily focusing on displaying flight search records.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\SearchHistory.jsx`**
    *   **10/12/2025, 12:16:09 PM**: Initial creation of the `SearchHistory` component. It includes state for filtering, pagination, table data, and an `activeTab` with predefined tabs ("flight", "hotel", "transfer", "attraction"). A `useFormik` instance `filterData` is set up with initial values for task-related filtering, though much of the UI and data fetching logic is commented out. The component primarily renders a `Pageheader` and tab navigation.
    *   **10/12/2025, 12:20:27 PM - 12:20:47 PM**: Minor UI adjustments, including importing and uncommenting a `ButtonFilter` and `DateRangeWirhoutCalender` component for filter controls, then re-commenting a refresh button.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:45:25 PM**: Underwent a significant refactor. Most of the state variables (related to filtering, pagination, table data) and form logic (`filterData`, `HandleSetApiResponse`, `fetchAllData`, `clearFilter`) were removed. The component was streamlined to act primarily as a tab container, delegating the content rendering for the "flight" tab to a newly imported `FlightHistory` component.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:46:46 PM**: Explicitly passed `authLoading`, `token`, `user`, and `hasPermission` props to the `FlightHistory` child component.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**
    *   **10/12/2025, 12:23:35 PM**: Initially created as a placeholder component rendering "FlightHistory".
    *   **10/12/2025, 12:25:08 PM**: Expanded to include the state management, `useFormik` filter setup (with task-related initial values), and placeholder API/response handling (`HandleSetApiResponse`, commented-out `fetchAllData`) that was previously in `SearchHistory.jsx`. It also includes basic filter UI components.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:42:47 PM**: `filterData.initialValues` were updated to be flight-specific (e.g., `origin`, `destination`, `outboundDate`). The `fetchAllData` function was uncommented and updated to make a POST request to `/flightSearchResources`, marking the start of actual data fetching implementation.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:45:44 PM - 1:46:19 PM**: Refactored to receive user/auth context via props instead of `useContextAuth`. Imports for `useFormik`, `useState`, `ButtonFilter`, and `DateRangeWirhoutCalender` were added to this file.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:47:45 PM**: The `company` field in `filterData.initialValues` was set to dynamically use `user?.company_id` and `user?.company_uid`.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:48:19 PM - 1:48:49 PM**: The `useEffect` hook was activated to trigger `fetchAllData` upon authentication changes. Imports for `useEffect`, `axiosTseInstance`, and `exportHeader` were added. `fetchAllData` logic was refined to handle dynamic payloads based on form values. A typo in a `console.log` was fixed.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:56:34 PM - 1:58:32 PM**: The `fetchAllData` function was significantly enhanced to build a conditional payload (`defaultPayload` or `formikPayload`) based on whether formik values should be used. This involved converting payload from an array to an object and refining how `filterData.values` are accessed.
    *   **10/12/2025, 1:59:57 PM - 2:00:40 PM**: Corrected the `axiosTseInstance.post` call to pass the `payload` directly as the request body and added `await` to the API call for proper asynchronous handling.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:01:50 PM - 2:02:46 PM**: `HandleSetApiResponse` was updated to receive and process `listData` (likely the API response), specifically setting the `tableData` state. Other functionalities within `HandleSetApiResponse` were commented out.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:09:18 PM**: Imports for `DataTableList` and `defaultSearchFlightList` (a constant for table configuration) were added. `HandleSetApiResponse` was updated to set `tableHeader` using `defaultSearchFlightList?.list_config`. The `DataTableList` component was uncommented in the JSX, though most of its props remained commented.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:17:19 PM - 2:17:42 PM**: Introduced `useMemo` and `generateTableColumns` for dynamic table column generation based on `tableHeader`. Custom template functions (`outboundTemplate`, `inboundTemplate`, `updatedDateTemplate`) were defined for specific column rendering, and `formatDate` was imported.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:19:21 PM - 2:19:39 PM**: Imported `ActionColumnTemplate` and defined an `actionColumn` function for table rows, integrating it into `generateTableColumns`.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:20:58 PM - 2:21:15 PM**: Added a `loading` state and integrated it with `DataTableList` and `HandleSetApiResponse`.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:22:47 PM**: Explicitly imported `formatDate` for use in column templates.
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:30:44 PM - 2:31:32 PM**: Added `originTemplate`, `destinationTemplate`, and `itemTemplate` functions for more detailed column rendering, further customizing the table display and integrating them into `generateTableColumns`. The `paginator` prop for `DataTableList` was uncommented and set to `true`.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\components\UI\DataTable\DataTableList.jsx`**
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:21:38 PM**: This file was introduced (or heavily updated) to provide a generic `DataTableList` component. It acts as a wrapper for PrimeReact's `DataTable` and `Paginator`. It includes prop types, state for pagination, functions for page changes, and utilities for stripping HTML tags from content. It dynamically renders columns based on `tableColumn` prop, supports indexing, and displays `Loader` or `EmptyData` based on `loading` and data presence.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`**
    *   **10/12/2025, 2:28:45 PM**: This new file defines configuration constants. `defaultSearchFlightList` contains `list_config` which specifies the default column headers and properties (field name, label, sortable, width, etc.) for the flight search history table. It also includes `create_info` for task-related form fields, though these are not directly used in the flight history display.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Component Modularity**: A clear pattern of refactoring the `SearchHistory` component to be a tab container and delegating specific tab logic (e.g., `FlightHistory`) to dedicated child components. This promotes a cleaner separation of concerns.
2.  **State Management**: Consistent use of React's `useState` hook for managing local component state (loading, filtering, pagination) and `useFormik` for robust form handling and validation.
3.  **Data Fetching**: Repeated pattern of using `useEffect` to trigger data fetching (`fetchAllData`) when authentication status (`authLoading`, `token`) changes. API calls are made via `axiosTseInstance.post` to a specific endpoint (`/flightSearchResources`) with dynamic payloads and headers.
4.  **Dynamic Table Rendering**: The application employs a configurable approach to render data tables. This involves:
    *   Defining column configurations in a separate constant (`defaultSearchFlightList`).
    *   Using a `generateTableColumns` utility function to create the actual `primereact` `Column` components.
    *   Leveraging `useMemo` to optimize table column generation.
    *   Implementing custom template functions (e.g., `outboundTemplate`, `originTemplate`) to format specific column data, ensuring flexibility in display.
5.  **UI Components**: Consistent use of reusable UI components such as `Pageheader`, `ButtonFilter`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`, `DataTableList` (a custom wrapper for PrimeReact), `ActionColumnTemplate`, `Loader`, and `EmptyData`.
6.  **Progressive Implementation**: The logs show a step-by-step implementation, where functionalities (like `useEffect` for data fetching, specific column templates, loading states) are initially commented out or basic, then gradually uncommented, refined, and made functional.
7.  **Console Logging**: Frequent use of `console.log` for debugging, especially during API call setup and prop passing.

## 3:39:25 PM
The log details a series of focused changes made on 10/12/2025, specifically between 3:15 PM and 3:38 PM, targeting a flight search and history feature within a Supabase CRM application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:15:34 PM:** This file was initially defined, exporting `taskConstant` (with task statuses and priorities) and `defaultSearchFlightList`. The `defaultSearchFlightList` object provides a `list_config` for displaying flight data (e.g., `id`, `flightRef`, `originFull`, `outboundDate`, `destinationFull`, `inboundDate`, `createdAt`, `items`) and `filter_info` for search criteria (e.g., `origin`, `destination`, `filterStartDate`, `filterEndDate`, `inboundDate`, `outboundDate`, `flightRef`).
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:16:04 PM:** A new filter field, `"company"`, was added to the `filter_info` within `defaultSearchFlightList`, expanding the filtering capabilities to include company-specific searches.

2.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:16:33 PM:** This is the initial entry for the `FlightHistory` React component. It imports `defaultSearchFlightList` and implements state management for table data, pagination, and filtering. It defines helper functions for date and location formatting, sets up `formik` for filter form handling, and includes an `useEffect` hook to fetch data. The component renders a `DataTableList` and a `FilterModal`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:21:40 PM:** A new `openFilter` state was added to control the visibility of the filter modal. Notably, the `FilterModal` component in the JSX was temporarily commented out.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:22:51 PM:** The `FilterModal` component in the JSX was uncommented, restoring its functionality.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:23:06 PM:** An explicit import for `FilterModal` from its component path was added.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:23:30 PM:** A `btnLoading` state was introduced, likely to manage loading indicators during filter submission.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:23:42 PM:** An explicit import for `TaskFilterBody` was added, which is used as the content for the `FilterModal`, resolving a dependency.

3.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightFilterBody.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:35:35 PM:** This file provides the filter interface for flight history. It dynamically renders input fields based on `filterInfo`, including a date range picker for "Created Date", text inputs for "Reference" and "Origin", an Ant Design `DatePicker` for "Outbound Date", and `FilterDropDown` components for "Destination", "Created By", and "Updated By" (utilizing user data from `useFetchComUser`).
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:38:26 PM:** Minor refinements were made to input fields: the `name` attributes for `flightRef` and `origin` were updated to dynamically use `filterInfo?.field`. More significantly, the `destination` input was changed from a `FilterDropDown` (which used `comUser`) to a standard `input type="text"`, and a new `inboundDate` filter, using an Ant Design `DatePicker`, was introduced.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configuration-Driven Development:** The `SearchFlightList.js` file serves as a central configuration for the data table columns and filter options, which are then consumed by the `FlightHistory.jsx` and `FlightFilterBody.jsx` components. This promotes consistency and ease of modification for the interface.
*   **Rapid Iteration on UI Components:** The timestamps show a quick succession of changes to `FlightHistory.jsx` (within ~7 minutes), indicating active development and refinement of the filtering mechanism and its associated modal. The temporary commenting out and subsequent uncommenting of the `FilterModal` highlight this iterative process.
*   **Standardized Form Handling:** The `useFormik` hook is consistently used across components for managing form state, initial values, and submission logic.
*   **Modular UI Components:** The project utilizes a `components/UI` directory for reusable UI elements like `ButtonFilter`, `DataTableList`, `DateRangeWirhoutCalender`, `FilterModal`, and `FilterDropDown`.
*   **Date Handling:** Both custom `DateRangeWirhoutCalender` and Ant Design's `DatePicker` (integrated with `dayjs`) are used for date selection, alongside a `formatDate` utility for consistent display.
*   **Dynamic Field Rendering:** `FlightFilterBody.jsx` demonstrates dynamic rendering of filter inputs based on the `filterInfo` configuration, allowing the UI to adapt to different filter requirements.

## 4:39:54 PM
The provided log details a series of changes focused on developing and refining a flight history search and filtering interface within a Supabase CRM client application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\hooks\fetch\useFetchCompany.jsx` (originally `useFetchCompanyjsx`):**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:47 PM - 3:51 PM:** The file was initially named `useFetchCompanyjsx` and the `useFetchComUser` hook had a critical syntax error where its name was omitted from the `export const` declaration. This was quickly rectified, and the file was correctly renamed to `useFetchCompany.jsx`. State variables were also renamed from `company` to `companies`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:52 PM - 3:57 PM:** The Supabase query logic underwent several changes. Initially, it filtered companies by `company_id`. This filter was temporarily removed, then re-added, but the filtering column was changed to `mother_company_id`. The `comId` for filtering is now explicitly derived from `user?.company_id?.toString()`. The `useEffect` dependencies were also adjusted to correctly trigger fetches based on `token` and `comId`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:02 PM:** The Supabase `select` statement was modified to fetch `company_no` instead of `company_id`.
    *   Throughout the changes, there were instances of adding/removing `console.log` statements for debugging purposes.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightFilterBody.jsx`:**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:49 PM:** This component was introduced to render a filter form for flight history, including date range pickers, text inputs for reference, origin, destination, and dropdowns for company and updated by. It integrated the `useFetchCompany` hook.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:50 PM - 4:07 PM:** The "Company" and "Updated By" filter sections were initially commented out in the JSX, then the "Company" filter was uncommented and configured to use the `companies` data from the `useFetchCompany` hook. A potential typo (`mompany` instead of `company`) was introduced in the `setFieldValue` call for the company filter. The casing for `filterInfo?.Company` was corrected to `filterInfo?.company` for consistency.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:17 PM - 4:20 PM:** A regression occurred where the `outboundDate` date picker was removed, and the `destination` field was erroneously replaced by a date picker. This issue was identified and fixed, restoring the `outboundDate` date picker and making `destination` a text input again.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:23 PM:** The value access for the `outboundDate` DatePicker was refined from `filterData.values[filterInfo?.outboundDate.field]` to `filterData.values['outboundDate']`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:35 PM:** The `onChange` logic for the `inboundDate` DatePicker was adjusted to return an empty string (`''`) instead of `null` when a date is cleared.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`:**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 3:50 PM:** This main component orchestrates the flight history view, managing state for table data, filters, and loading. It uses `useFormik` for filter data and renders `FlightFilterBody` within a `FilterModal`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:04 PM:** A critical fix was implemented in `HandleSetApiResponse` to correctly load the filter configuration from `defaultSearchFlightList?.filter_info` (instead of `filter_config`).
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:11 PM - 4:13 PM:** The `initialValues` for the `useFormik` instance were repeatedly updated with various hardcoded test strings and dates, indicating active development and testing of the filtering functionality.

*   **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`:**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:06 PM:** This file defines constants for task statuses/priorities and the configuration for the flight search list (`list_config`) and filter (`filter_info`).
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:08 PM:** The `created_at` field within `filter_info` was renamed to `updated_at`, and its label was updated from "Created Date" to "Updated Date" to reflect a change in the intended filtering field.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/12/2025, 3:51:27 PM:** Corrected `useFetchCompany` hook definition and file name.
*   **10/12/2025, 3:57:49 PM:** Changed Supabase query filter in `useFetchCompany` from `company_id` to `mother_company_id`.
*   **10/12/2025, 4:04:09 PM:** Fixed `filterInfo` loading logic in `FlightHistory`.
*   **10/12/2025, 4:08:34 PM:** Renamed `created_at` filter to `updated_at` in `SearchFlightList.js`.
*   **10/12/2025, 4:17:59 PM - 4:20:40 PM:** Period of regression and subsequent fix regarding DatePicker components in `FlightFilterBody`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging:** The log shows a clear pattern of incremental changes, often introducing bugs (e.g., syntax errors, incorrect filter logic, UI regressions) and then promptly fixing them in subsequent commits. The frequent use of `console.log` and hardcoded test values in Formik initial states indicates active debugging.
*   **Supabase Integration:** The application heavily relies on Supabase for data fetching, with specific queries and filters being refined over time.
*   **UI Component-Based Development:** Components like `FlightFilterBody` and `FlightHistory` are used to build the interface, utilizing Ant Design's `DatePicker` and custom UI components like `DateRangepicker` and `FilterDropDown`.
*   **Form Management with Formik:** `useFormik` is a central tool for handling form state, validation, and submission logic across the filtering interface.
*   **Configuration-Driven UI:** The `defaultSearchFlightList` constant is used to dynamically configure table columns and filter fields, demonstrating a pattern of externalizing UI structure.

## 5:39:49 PM
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript/JSX files, primarily focusing on flight search and task filtering functionalities within a Supabase CRM client application.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\constants\Settings\Interface\SearchFlightList.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 4:40:09 PM**
        This file was initially committed or modified to define `taskConstant` (for task statuses and priorities) and `defaultSearchFlightList`. The `defaultSearchFlightList` constant configures both the display columns (`list_config`) and the available filter fields (`filter_info`) for flight search. This includes fields like `id`, `flightRef`, `originFull`, `outboundDate`, `destinationFull`, `inboundDate`, `createdAt`, `items` for the list, and `updated_at`, `origin`, `destination`, `filterStartDate`, `filterEndDate`, `inboundDate`, `outboundDate`, `flightRef`, `company`, `type` for filters.

2.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightFilterBody.jsx`**
    This file saw numerous small, incremental changes, primarily related to the implementation and debugging of `DatePicker` and `FilterDropDown` components.
    *   **Initial Setup (around 10/12/2025, 4:41:09 PM - 4:44:23 PM):** The component was set up to render various filter inputs (text fields, date pickers, dropdowns) based on `filterInfo`. `DatePicker` components for `outboundDate` and `inboundDate` were configured using `antd`'s `DatePicker` and `dayjs` for date formatting (DD/MM/YYYY). There was initial experimentation with the `minDate` prop for `inboundDate`, with it being commented out and re-added.
    *   **DatePicker Value Handling Refinements (around 10/12/2025, 4:45:25 PM - 4:48:19 PM):** The logic for handling `DatePicker` values was frequently adjusted. Initially, values were conditionally parsed with `dayjs` or set to `null`. This was briefly changed to always attempt parsing a `dayjs` object (potentially problematic for empty values) and even hardcoded to a specific date (`'01/05/2025'`) for debugging. Later, the value handling was refined to conditionally parse or default to an empty string, and a temporary bug where `inboundDate`'s `name` prop incorrectly pointed to `outboundDate` was introduced and then corrected. The `minDate` prop for `outboundDate` was also toggled.
    *   **Console Logging and FilterDropDown Logic Updates (around 10/12/2025, 5:11:07 PM - 5:13:52 PM):**
        *   The `console.log` statement was changed to log `filterData.values` comprehensively.
        *   A significant fix was implemented for the `company` `FilterDropDown`. The `value` prop was updated to expect an array (`filterData.values.company[0]`), and the `onChange` handler was corrected to properly set the `company` field in the formik state, storing both the `id` and the `company_uid` as an array (`[selectedCompany.id, selectedCompany.company_uid]`). This also involved fixing a typo from `mompany` to `company` and `triim` to `trim`.
    *   **Date Format Change (10/12/2025, 5:15:27 PM - 5:17:55 PM):** The `format` prop for `outboundDate` and `inboundDate` `DatePicker` components was changed from `DD/MM/YYYY` to `YYYY-MM-DD`, standardizing the input/output format.

3.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Task\parts\TaskFilterBody.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 5:03:19 PM**
        This file defines a `TaskFilterBody` component, structurally similar to `FlightFilterBody`. It uses `DateRangepicker`, `FilterDropDown`, and `Select` components for filtering tasks by creation/update dates, subject, status, priority, and assignees/creators/updaters. It leverages `taskConstant` (from a different path than `SearchFlightList.js`) and a `useFetchComUser` hook.

4.  **`h:\wamp64\www\supabase-crm\client-CRM-supabase\src\pages\backend\Interface\SearchHistory\FlightHistory\FlightHistory.jsx`**
    *   **Initial Setup and Formik Configuration (around 10/12/2025, 4:48:43 PM):** The main `FlightHistory` component was introduced. It manages state for data fetching, loading, filtering, and pagination. It defines column templates for flight data (`outboundDate`, `inboundDate`, `createdAt`, `originFull`, `destinationFull`, `item`). It uses `formik` for filter management, with `initialValues` including placeholder strings for text fields and an array for `company`. Data fetching (`fetchAllData`) is handled via `axiosTseInstance` to `/flightSearchResources`.
    *   **Filter Submission Logic (around 10/12/2025, 5:05:58 PM - 5:06:38 PM):** The `onSubmit` handler for the filter form was modified to set `btnLoading` to `false` and include a `console.log` of the submitted values. The actual `handleFilterFormSubmit` call remained commented out.
    *   **Activating Filter Submission (10/12/2025, 5:16:21 PM):** The `onSubmit` handler was updated to actively call `fetchAllData(true)`, ensuring that filter submissions trigger a data fetch with the new form values.
    *   **Initial Values Refinement (around 10/12/2025, 5:19:04 PM - 5:19:27 PM):** Placeholder string values in `formik`'s `initialValues` (e.g., `'asda'`) were replaced with empty strings (`''`). A duplicated `destination` field in `initialValues` was removed. The `reference` field was corrected to `flightRef` in `initialValues` to align with the `filter_info` structure.
    *   **Payload Field Correction (10/12/2025, 5:33:21 PM):** A critical bug was fixed in `fetchAllData` where `formikPayload` was using `values.updated_start_date` and `values.updated_end_date` for `filterStartDate` and `filterEndDate`. This was corrected to use `values.filterStartDate` and `values.filterEndDate`, aligning the payload keys with the actual formik initial values and the `DateRangepicker` component's `startName`/`endName` props.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Date Handling with `dayjs` and `antd`:** There's a strong pattern of using `antd`'s `DatePicker` and `dayjs` library for date input and formatting, particularly for `outboundDate`, `inboundDate`, and date range filters. Frequent adjustments to parsing, formatting (`DD/MM/YYYY` vs `YYYY-MM-DD`), and `minDate` indicate an ongoing effort to perfect date field behavior.
*   **Formik for Form Management:** The `useFormik` hook is consistently used across filter components (`FlightFilterBody`, `FlightHistory`) to manage form state, initial values, and submission logic.
*   **Dynamic UI based on `filterInfo`:** Components often render elements conditionally (`filterInfo?.fieldName.type === "1" && (...)`), suggesting a configurable filter interface derived from a central constant.
*   **API Interaction:** Data fetching for flight history consistently involves a `POST` request to `/flightSearchResources` using `axiosTseInstance`, with `exportHeader` and a structured payload including `companyId`, date ranges, and other filter criteria.
*   **Component Structure:** Both `FlightHistory` and `TaskFilterBody` follow a similar structure of importing UI components (`DateRangepicker`, `FilterDropDown`, `DatePicker`), hooks (`useFetchCompany`, `useFetchComUser`), and constants for their functionality.
*   **Debugging with `console.log`:** Frequent additions and modifications to `console.log` statements throughout the development process highlight active debugging of formik values and component states.
*   **Typo and Inconsistency Corrections:** Several changes involved fixing typos (e.g., `mompany`, `triim`) and aligning field names between `formik`'s initial values, UI components' props, and the API payload structure.
