# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 1:13:47 PM
The log shows changes made to React components within a Supabase-integrated CRM project.  The `.env` file, containing environment variables (URLs, tokens, and keys), is omitted for security reasons.

The `ModilfySearch.jsx` component underwent two minor revisions between 12:29:57 PM and 12:30:28 PM. The only change was updating the `mb-5` class to `mb-6` in the outer div, suggesting a minor styling adjustment.

The `Timer.jsx` component experienced multiple updates between 12:37:33 PM and 12:38:36 PM. These changes primarily focused on refining the styling and presentation of the timer component.  Specifically, the text size of "Act Fast!" message was adjusted from `text-sm` to `text-base` and then back to `text-sm` and additional padding was added to the message. These edits suggest iterative improvements to the user interface.  The core functionality of the countdown timer, modal display, and search refresh remained unchanged throughout these revisions.  The consistent header comments indicating project details and developers  (`Mehdi Hasan, Motalib Hossain`) are notable.
