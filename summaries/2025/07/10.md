# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 1:46:01 PM
The log shows three revisions of `FlightSearch.jsx`, all within a short time frame on July 10th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all versions: fetching and displaying flight search results.

The most significant changes occur in the `selectFlightHandeller` function.  The initial version (12:46:30 PM) passes the flight `id` to the `selectFlight` redux action. The subsequent revisions (1:00:46 PM and 1:00:51 PM) modify this to pass the flight `index` instead. Additionally, a `finally` block is added in the last two revisions to ensure cleanup, likely related to a state variable `setSelectingIndex` (although its definition is not shown).

There are no major structural changes to the component's rendering logic. The component consistently uses React hooks (`useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, etc.) and Redux for state management.  The UI displays flight data in a paginated format, incorporating loading indicators and visual elements using styled components.  The `getInitialAvailStrings` function processes flight data to extract availability strings, with a slight refinement to handle cases where `multiFlights` are missing in the later revisions.  The overall changes appear to be iterative refinements and bug fixes rather than a complete overhaul of the component.
