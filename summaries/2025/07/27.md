# Activity Summary for 7/27/2025

The log shows multiple revisions of the `Create.jsx` file,  all related to a React component for creating company records.  The primary focus of the changes is enhancing the user interface and the company creation functionality.

The earliest revisions (2:19:50 PM, 2:26:43 PM, 2:28:31 PM, 2:28:47 PM) primarily involve minor adjustments and debugging. The most significant change occurs between the initial versions and the revision at 2:38:28 PM. This revision introduces several key improvements:

* **Improved Contact Information Selection:**  A `FilterDropDown` component replaces a simple text input for selecting contact information. This provides a better user experience by allowing selection from a list.

* **Enhanced "Is Parent" and "Corporate" Functionality:** The checkboxes for "Is Parent" and "Corporate" are modified to create an interdependency, making the UI more intuitive and enforcing business logic (a company can't be both corporate and a parent company at the same time). The `mother_company_id` is now conditionally set based on the "Is Parent" checkbox state.

* **Addition of Company Website Field:** A new field for "company_website" is added to the form.

* **Refactoring of Imports:** Some imports are updated, replacing `fetchListAllData`  with a custom hook `useFetchComUser` and directly importing `fetchCountries` for fetching country options.  The `setPageLoading` function is passed as a parameter to `fetchAllData`.

The final revision at 3:04:30 PM contains a minor typo fix in `fetchListAllData`.  Overall, the changes exhibit a clear pattern of iterative development focusing on improving the user interface, integrating better data fetching mechanisms, and refining the logic for handling company types.
