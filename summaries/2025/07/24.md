# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

The `FlightContent.jsx` component, last updated on July 24, 2025, at 12:44:14 PM, is a React component for searching flights.  It uses several UI libraries like `@headlessui/react`, `@mui/material`, and `antd`.  The component manages flight search parameters including departure and return dates, airports, passenger counts (adults, children, infants), cabin class, and airline.

Key features include:

* **Date Handling:** Uses `dayjs` for date manipulation and `antd`'s `DatePicker` for user input.  Departure date changes automatically adjust the minimum return date and maximum selectable year.
* **Airport Swapping:**  A `switchAirports` function allows users to easily swap departure and return airports.
* **Form Submission:** The `submitForm` function gathers search parameters, formats them (including converting dates to 'YYYY-MM-DD'), and saves them to `sessionStorage`. It then navigates to `/admin/flight-search` with the search parameters as query string parameters.  A one-second delay is introduced using `setTimeout` before navigation and dispatching the search data via Redux.  The search data also includes detailed airport information.
* **Passenger Count Control:** Functions like `setAdultController`, `setChildController`, and `setInfantController` manage passenger counts, ensuring the total does not exceed 9.
* **Redux Integration:** Uses `useDispatch` to update the Redux store (`flightSearchSlice`) with the search data.
* **Authentication:** Uses a custom hook `useAuth` to access user authentication data (`user.company_uid`).
* **Extensive Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose and functionality of each function.

The component's logic is focused on preparing and submitting search data, handling user interactions, and ensuring data consistency.  The use of `sessionStorage` suggests the intention to persist search criteria across sessions.  The structure suggests a robust and well-organized approach to flight search functionality.
